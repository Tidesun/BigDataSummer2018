act
ii
scene
i
rome
a
public
place

enter
menenius
with
the
two
tribunes
of
the
people
sicinius
and
brutus

menenius
the
augurer
tells
me
we
shall
have
news
tonight
brutus
good
or
bad
menenius
not
according
to
the
prayer
of
the
people
for
they
love
not
marcius
sicinius
nature
teaches
beasts
to
know
their
friends
menenius
pray
you
who
does
the
wolf
love
sicinius
the
lamb
menenius
ay
to
devour
him
as
the
hungry
plebeians
would
the
noble
marcius
brutus
hes
a
lamb
indeed
that
baes
like
a
bear
menenius
hes
a
bear
indeed
that
lives
fike
a
lamb
you
two
are
old
men
tell
me
one
thing
that
i
shall
ask
you
both
tribunes
well
sir
menenius
in
what
enormity
is
marcius
poor
in
that
you
two
have
not
in
abundance
brutus
hes
poor
in
no
one
fault
but
stord
with
all
sicinius
especially
in
pride
brutus
and
topping
all
others
in
boasting
menenius
this
is
strange
now
do
you
two
know
how
you
are
censured
here
in
the
city
i
mean
of
us
o
th
righthand
file
do
you
both
tribunes
why
how
are
we
censurd
menenius
because
you
talk
of
pride
now
will
you
not
be
angry
both
tribunes
well
well
sir
well
menenius
why
tis
no
great
matter
for
a
very
little
thief
of
occasion
will
rob
you
of
a
great
deal
of
patience
give
your
dispositions
the
reins
and
be
angry
at
your
pleasures
at
the
least
if
you
take
it
as
a
pleasure
to
you
in
being
so
you
blame
marcius
for
being
proud
brutus
we
do
it
not
alone
sir
menenius
i
know
you
can
do
very
little
alone
for
your
helps
are
many
or
else
your
actions
would
grow
wondrous
single
your
abilities
are
too
infantlike
for
doing
much
alone
you
talk
of
pride
o
that
you
could
turn
your
eyes
toward
the
napes
of
your
necks
and
make
but
an
interior
survey
of
your
good
selves
o
that
you
could
both
tribunes
what
then
sir
menenius
why
then
you
should
discover
a
brace
of
unmeriting
proud
violent
testy
magistratesalias
fools
as
any
in
rome
sicinius
menenius
you
are
known
well
enough
too
menenius
i
am
known
to
be
a
humorous
patrician
and
one
that
loves
a
cup
of
hot
wine
with
not
a
drop
of
allaying
tiber
int
said
to
be
something
imperfect
in
favouring
the
first
complaint
hasty
and
tinderlike
upon
too
trivial
motion
one
that
converses
more
with
the
buttock
of
the
night
than
with
the
forehead
of
the
morning
what
i
think
i
utter
and
spend
my
malice
in
my
breath
meeting
two
such
wealsmen
as
you
are
i
cannot
call
you
lycurguses
if
the
drink
you
give
me
touch
my
palate
adversely
i
make
a
crooked
face
at
it
i
cannot
say
your
worships
have
deliverd
the
matter
well
when
i
find
the
ass
in
compound
with
the
major
part
of
your
syllables
and
though
i
must
be
content
to
bear
with
those
that
say
you
are
reverend
grave
men
yet
they
lie
deadly
that
tell
you
you
have
good
faces
if
you
see
this
in
the
map
of
my
microcosm
follows
it
that
i
am
known
well
enough
too
what
harm
can
your
bisson
conspectuities
glean
out
of
this
character
if
i
be
known
well
enough
too
brutus
come
sir
come
we
know
you
well
enough
menenius
you
know
neither
me
yourselves
nor
any
thing
you
are
ambitious
for
poor
knaves
caps
and
legs
you
wear
out
a
good
wholesome
forenoon
in
hearing
a
cause
between
an
orangewife
and
a
fossetseller
and
then
rejourn
the
controversy
of
threepence
to
a
second
day
of
audience
when
you
are
hearing
a
matter
between
party
and
party
if
you
chance
to
be
pinchd
with
the
colic
you
make
faces
like
mummers
set
up
the
bloody
flag
against
all
patience
and
in
roaring
for
a
chamberpot
dismiss
the
controversy
bleeding
the
more
entangled
by
your
hearing
all
the
peace
you
make
in
their
cause
is
calling
both
the
parties
knaves
you
are
a
pair
of
strange
ones
brutus
come
come
you
are
well
understood
to
be
a
perfecter
giber
for
the
table
than
a
necessary
bencher
in
the
capitol
menenius
our
very
priests
must
become
mockers
if
they
shall
encounter
such
ridiculous
subjects
as
you
are
when
you
speak
best
unto
the
purpose
it
is
not
worth
the
wagging
of
your
beards
and
your
beards
deserve
not
so
honourable
a
grave
as
to
stuff
a
botchers
cushion
or
to
be
entombd
in
an
asss
packsaddle
yet
you
must
be
saying
marcius
is
proud
who
in
a
cheap
estimation
is
worth
all
your
predecessors
since
deucalion
though
peradventure
some
of
the
best
of
em
were
hereditary
hangmen
godden
to
your
worships
more
of
your
conversation
would
infect
my
brain
being
the
herdsmen
of
the
beastly
plebeians
i
will
be
bold
to
take
my
leave

very
wishes

the
buildings
of

theres
one
thing
wanting
which
i
doubt

but
our
rome
will
cast
upon
thee
coriolanus
know
good
mother
i
had
rather
be
their
servant
in
my
way
than
sway
with
them
in
theirs
cominius
on
to
the
capitol
flourish
cornets
exeunt
in
state
as
before

brutus
and
sicinius
come
forward

brutus
all
tongues
speak
of
him
and
the
bleared
sights
are
spectacled
to
see
him
your
prattling
nurse
into
a
rapture
lets
her
baby
cry
while
she
chats
him
the
kitchen
malkin
pins
her
richest
lockram
bout
her
reechy
neck
clambring
the
walls
to
eye
him
stalls
bulks
windows
are
smotherd
up
leads
filld
and
ridges
horsd
with
variable
complexions
all
agreeing
in
earnestness
to
see
him
seldshown
flamens
do
press
among
the
popular
throngs
and
puff
to
win
a
vulgar
station
our
veild
dames
commit
the
war
of
white
and
damask
in
their
nicely
gawded
cheeks
to
th
wanton
spoil
of
phoebus
burning
kisses
such
a
pother
as
if
that
whatsoever
god
who
leads
him
were
slily
crept
into
his
human
powers
and
gave
him
graceful
posture
sicinius
on
the
sudden
i
warrant
him
consul
brutus
then
our
office
may
during
his
power
go
sleep
sicinius
he
cannot
temprately
transport
his
honours
from
where
he
should
begin
and
end
but
will
lose
those
he
hath
won
brutus
in
that
theres
comfort
sicinius
doubt
not
the
commoners
for
whom
we
stand
but
they
upon
their
ancient
malice
will
forget
with
the
least
cause
these
his
new
honours
which
that
he
will
give
them
make
i
as
little
question
as
he
is
proud
to
dot
brutus
i
heard
him
swear
were
he
to
stand
for
consul
never
would
he
appear
i
th
marketplace
nor
on
him
put
the
napless
vesture
of
humility
nor
showing
as
the
manner
is
his
wounds
to
th
people
beg
their
stinking
breaths
sicinius
tis
right
brutus
it
was
his
word
o
he
would
miss
it
rather
than
carry
it
but
by
the
suit
of
the
gentry
to
him
and
the
desire
of
the
nobles
sicinius
i
wish
no
better
than
have
him
hold
that
purpose
and
to
put
it
in
execution
brutus
tis
most
like
he
will
sicinius
it
shall
be
to
him
then
as
our
good
wills
a
sure
destruction
brutus
so
it
must
fall
out
to
him
or
our
authorities
for
an
end
we
must
suggest
the
people
in
what
hatred
he
still
hath
held
them
that
tos
power
he
would
have
made
them
mules
silencd
their
pleaders
and
dispropertied
their
freedoms
holding
them
in
human
action
and
capacity
of
no
more
soul
nor
fitness
for
the
world
than
camels
in
their
war
who
have
their
provand
only
for
bearing
burdens
and
sore
blows
for
sinking
under
them
sicinius
this
as
you
say
suggested
at
some
time
when
his
soaring
insolence
shall
touch
the
people
which
time
shall
not
want
if
he
be
put
upont
and
thats
as
easy
as
to
set
dogs
on
sheep
will
be
his
fire
to
kindle
their
dry
stubble
and
their
blaze
shall
darken
him
for
ever

enter
a
messenger

brutus
whats
the
matter
messenger
you
are
sent
for
to
the
capitol
tis
thought
that
marcius
shall
be
consul
i
have
seen
the
dumb
men
throng
to
see
him
and
the
blind
to
hear
him
speak
matrons
flung
gloves
ladies
and
maids
their
scarfs
and
handkerchers
upon
him
as
he
passd
the
nobles
bended
as
to
joves
statue
and
the
commons
made
a
shower
and
thunder
with
their
caps
and
shouts
i
never
saw
the
like
brutus
lets
to
the
capitol
and
carry
with
us
ears
and
eyes
for
th
time
but
hearts
for
the

exeunt




scene
ii
rome
the
capitol

enter
two
officers
to
lay
cushions
as
it
were
in
the
capitol

first
officer
come
come
they
are
almost
here
how
many
stand
for
consulships
second
officer
three
they
say
but
tis
thought
of
every
one
coriolanus
will
carry
it
first
officer
thats
a
brave
fellow
but
hes
vengeance
proud
and
loves
not
the
common
people
second
officer
faith
there
have
been
many
great
men
that
have
flatterd
the
people
who
neer
loved
them
and
there
be
many
that
they
have
loved
they
know
not
wherefore
so
that
if
they
love
they
know
not
why
they
hate
upon
no
better
a
ground
therefore
for
coriolanus
neither
to
care
whether
they
love
or
hate
him
manifests
the
true
knowledge
he
has
in
their
disposition
and
out
of
his
noble
carelessness
lets
them
plainly
seet
first
officer
if
he
did
not
care
whether
he
had
their
love
or
no
he
waved
indifferently
twixt
doing
them
neither
good
nor
harm
but
he
seeks
their
hate
with
greater
devotion
than
they
can
render
it
him
and
leaves
nothing
undone
that
may
fully
discover
him
their
opposite
now
to
seem
to
affect
the
malice
and
displeasure
of
the
people
is
as
bad
as
that
which
he
dislikes
to
flatter
them
for
their
love
second
officer
he
hath
deserved
worthily
of
his
country
and
his
ascent
is
not
by
such
easy
degrees
as
those
who
having
been
supple
and
courteous
to
the
people
bonneted
without
any
further
deed
to
have
them
at
all
into
their
estimation
and
report
but
he
hath
so
planted
his
honours
in
their
eyes
and
his
actions
in
their
hearts
that
for
their
tongues
to
be
silent
and
not
confess
so
much
were
a
kind
of
ingrateful
injury
to
report
otherwise
were
a
malice
that
giving
itself
the
lie
would
pluck
reproof
and
rebuke
from
every
car
that
heard
it
first
officer
no
more
of
him
hes
a
worthy
man
make

themselves
coriolanus

menenius
having
determind
of
the

and
to
send
for

lartius
it
remains
as
the
main
point
of
this
our
aftermeeting
to
gratify
his
noble
service
that
hath
thus
stood
for
his
country
therefore
please
you
most
reverend
and
grave
elders
to
desire
the
present
consul
and
last
general
in
our
wellfound
successes
to
report
a
little
of
that
worthy
work
performd
by
caius
marcius
coriolanus
whom
we
met
here
both
to
thank
and
to
remember
with
honours
like
himself
















coriolanus
sits
first
senator
speak
good
cominius
leave
nothing
out
for
length
and
make
us
think
rather
our
states
defective
for
requital
than
we
to
stretch
it
out
masters
o
th
people
we
do
request
your
kindest
ears
and
after
your
loving
motion
toward
the
common
body
to
yield
what
passes
here
sicinius
we
are
convented
upon
a
pleasing
treaty
and
have
hearts
inclinable
to
honour
and
advance
the
theme
of
our
assembly
brutus
which
the
rather
we
shall
be
blessd
to
do
if
he
remember
a
kinder
value
of
the
people
than
he
hath
hereto
prizd
them
at
menenius
thats
off
thats
off
i
would
you
rather
had
been
silent
please
you
to
hear
cominius
speak
brutus
most
willingly
but
yet
my
caution
was
more
pertinent
than
the
rebuke
you
give
it
menenius
he
loves
your
people
but
tie
him
not
to
be
their
bedfellow
worthy
cominius
speak
coriolanus

and
offers
to
go
away
nay

your
place
first
senator

shame
to
hear
what
you
have
nobly
done
coriolanus
your
honours
pardon
i
had
rather
have
my
wounds
to
heal
again
than
hear
say
how
i
got
them
brutus
sir
i
hope
my
words
disbenchd
you
not
coriolanus
no
sir
yet
oft
when
blows
have
made
me
stay
i
fled
from
words
you
soothd
not
therefore
hurt
not
but
your
people
i
love
them
as
they
weigh
menenius
pray
now
sit
down
coriolanus
i
had
rather
have
one
scratch
my
head
i
th
sun
when
the
alarum
were
struck
than
idly
sit
to
hear
my
nothings
monsterd

























exit
menenius
masters
of
the
people
your
multiplying
spawn
how
can
he
flatter
thats
thousand
to
one
good
one
when
you
now
see
he
had
rather
venture
all
his
limbs
for
honour
than
one
ons
ears
to
hear
it
proceed
cominius
cominius
i
shall
lack
voice
the
deeds
of
coriolanus
should
not
be
utterd
feebly
it
is
held
that
valour
is
the
chiefest
virtue
and
most
dignifies
the
haver
if
it
be
the
man
i
speak
of
cannot
in
the
world
be
singly
counterpoisd
at
sixteen
years
when
tarquin
made
a
head
for
rome
he
fought
beyond
the
mark
of
others
our
then
dictator
whom
with
all
praise
i
point
at
saw
him
fight
when
with
his
amazonian
chin
he
drove
the
bristled
lips
before
him
he
bestrid
an
oerpressd
roman
and
i
th
consuls
view
slew
three
opposers
tarquins
self
he
met
and
struck
him
on
his
knee
in
that
days
feats
when
he
might
act
the
woman
in
the
scene
he
provd
best
man
i
th
field
and
for
his
meed
was
browbound
with
the
oak
his
pupil
age
manentred
thus
he
waxed
like
a
sea
and
in
the
brunt
of
seventeen
battles
since
he
lurchd
all
swords
of
the
garland
for
this
last
before
and
in
corioli
let
me
say
i
cannot
speak
him
home
he
stoppd
the
fliers
and
by
his
rare
example
made
the
coward
turn
terror
into
sport
as
weeds
before
a
vessel
under
sail
so
men
obeyd
and
fell
below
his
stem
his
sword
deaths
stamp
where
it
did
mark
it
took
from
face
to
foot
he
was
a
thing
of
blood
whose
every
motion
was
timd
with
dying
cries
alone
he
entred
the
mortal
gate
of
th
city
which
he
painted
with
shunless
destiny
aidless
came
off
and
with
a
sudden
reenforcement
struck
corioli
like
a
planet
now
alls
his
when
by
and
by
the
din
of
war
gan
pierce
his
ready
sense
then
straight
his
doubled
spirit
requickned
what
in
flesh
was
fatigate
and
to
the
battle
came
he
where
he
did
run
reeking
oer
the
lives
of
men
as
if
twere
a
perpetual
spoil
and
till
we
calld
both
field
and
city
ours
he
never
stood
to
ease
his
breast
with
panting
menenius
worthy
man
first
senator
he
cannot
but
with
measure
fit
the
honours
which
we
devise
him
cominius
our
spoils
he
kickd
at
and
lookd
upon
things
precious
as
they
were
the
common
muck
of
the
world
he
covets
less
than
misery
itself
would
give
rewards
his
deeds
with
doing
them
and
is
content
to
spend
the
time
to

it

exeunt




scene
iii
rome
the
forum

enter
seven
or
eight
citizens

first
citizen
once
if
he
do
require
our
voices
we
ought
not
to
deny
him
second
citizen
we
may
sir
if
we
will
third
citizen
we
have
power
in
ourselves
to
do
it
but
it
is
a
power
that
we
have
no
power
to
do
for
if
he
show
us
his
wounds
and
tell
us
his
deeds
we
are
to
put
our
tongues
into
those
wounds
and
speak
for
them
so
if
he
tell
us
his
noble
deeds
we
must
also
tell
him
our
noble
acceptance
of
them
ingratitude
is
monstrous
and
for
the
multitude
to
be
ingrateful
were
to
make
a
monster
of
the
multitude
of
the
which
we
being
members
should
bring
ourselves
to
be
monstrous
members
first
citizen
and
to
make
us
no
better
thought
of
a
little
help
will
serve
for
once
we
stood
up
about
the
corn
he
himself
stuck
not
to
call
us
the
manyheaded
multitude
third
citizen
we
have
been
calld
so
of
many
not
that
our
heads
are
some
brown
some
black
some
abram
some
bald
but
that
our
wits
are
so
diversely
colourd
and
truly
i
think
if
all
our
wits
were
to
issue
out
of
one
skull
they
would
fly
east
west
north
south
and
their
consent
of
one
direct
way
should
be
at
once
to
all
the
points
o
th
compass
second
citizen
think
you
so
which
way
do
you
judge
my
wit
would
fly
third
citizen
nay
your
wit
will
not
so
soon
out
as
another
mans
will
tis
strongly
wedgd
up
in
a
blockhead
but
if
it
were
at
liberty
twould
sure
southward
second
citizen
why
that
way
third
citizen
to
lose
itself
in
a
fog
where
being
three
parts
melted
away
with
rotten
dews
the
fourth
would
return
for
conscience
sake
to
help
to
get
thee
a
wife
second
citizen
you
are
never
without
your
tricks
you
may
you
may
third
citizen
are
you
all
resolvd
to
give
your
voices
but
thats
no
matter
the
greater
part
carries
it
i
say
if
he
would
incline
to
the
people
there
was
never
a
worthier
man

enter
coriolanus
in
a
gown
of
humility
with
menenius

here
he
comes
and
in
the
gown
of
humility
mark
his
behaviour
we
are
not
to
stay
all
together
but
to
come
by
him
where
he
stands
by
ones
by
twos
and
by
threes
hes
to
make
his
requests
by
particulars
wherein
every
one
of
us
has
a
single
honour
in
giving
him
our
own
voices
with
our
own
tongues
therefore
follow
me
and
ill
direct
you
how
you
shall
go
by
him

twas
never
my
desire

third

you
must
think
if

anything
we
hope
to
gain
by
you
coriolanus
well
then
i
pray
your
price
o
th
consulship
first

the
price
is
to

kindly
coriolanus
kindly

coriolanus

of
your
voices
that
i
may
be
consul
i
have
here
the
customary
gown
fourth
citizen
you
have
deserved
nobly
of
your
country
and
you
have
not
deserved
nobly
coriolanus
your
enigma
fourth
citizen
you
have
been
a
scourge
to
her
enemies
you
have
been
a
rod
to
her
friends
you
have
not
indeed
loved
the
common
people
coriolanus
you
should
account
me
the
more
virtuous
that
i
have
not
been
common
in
my
love
i
will
sir
flatter
my
sworn
brother
the
people
to
earn
a
dearer
estimation
of
them
tis
a
condition
they
account
gentle
and
since
the
wisdom
of
their
choice
is
rather
to
have
my
hat
than
my
heart
i
will
practise
the
insinuating
nod
and
be
off
to
them
most
counterfeitly
that
is
sir
i
will
counterfeit
the
bewitchment
of
some
popular
man
and
give
it
bountiful
to
the
desirers
therefore
beseech
you
i
may
be
consul
fifth
citizen
we
hope
to
find
you
our
friend
and
therefore
give
you
our
voices
heartily
fourth
citizen
you
have
received
many
wounds
for
your
country
coriolanus
i

heartily
exeunt

better
it

sicinius
how
now
my
masters
have
you
chose
this
man
first
citizen
he
has
our
voices
sir
brutus
we
pray
the
gods
he
may
deserve
your
loves
second
citizen
amen
sir
to
my
poor
unworthy
notice
he
mockd
us
when
he
beggd
our
voices
third
citizen
certainly
he
flouted
us
downright
first
citizen
no
tis
his
kind
of
speech
he
did
not
mock
us
second
citizen
not
one
amongst
us
save
yourself
but
says
he
usd
us
scornfully
he
should
have
showd
us
his
marks
of
merit
wounds
receivd
fors
country
sicinius
why
so
he
did
i
am
sure
all
no
no
no
man
saw
em
third
citizen
he
said
he
had
wounds
which
he
could
show
in
private
and
with
his
hat
thus
waving
it
in
scorn
i
would
be
consul
says
he
aged
custom
but
by
your
voices
will
not
so
permit
me
your
voices
therefore
when
we
granted
that
here
was
i
thank
you
for
your
voices
thank
you
your
most
sweet
voices
now
you
have
left
your
voices
i
have
no
further
with
you
was
not
this
mockery
sicinius
why
either
were
you
ignorant
to
seet
or
seeing
it
of
such
childish
friendliness
to
yield
your
voices
brutus
could
you
not
have
told
him
as
you
were
lessond
when
he
had
no
power
but
was
a
petty
servant
to
the
state
he
was
your
enemy
ever
spake
against
your
liberties
and
the
charters
that
you
bear
i
th
body
of
the
weal
and
now
arriving
a
place
of
potency
and
sway
o
th
state
if
he
should
still
malignantly
remain
fast
foe
to
th
plebeii
your
voices
might
be
curses
to
yourselves
you
should
have
said
that
as
his
worthy
deeds
did
claim
no
less
than
what
he
stood
for
so
his
gracious
nature
would
think
upon
you
for
your
voices
and
translate
his
malice
towards
you
into
love
standing
your
friendly
lord
sicinius
thus
to
have
said
as
you
were
foreadvisd
had
touchd
his
spirit
and
tried
his
inclination
from
him
pluckd
either
his
gracious
promise
which
you
might
as
cause
had
calld
you
up
have
held
him
to
or
else
it
would
have
galld
his
surly
nature
which
easily
endures
not
article
tying
him
to
aught
so
putting
him
to
rage
you
should
have
taen
th
advantage
of
his
choler
and
passd
him
unelected
brutus
did
you
perceive
he
did
solicit
you
in
free
contempt
when
he
did
need
your
loves
and
do
you
think
that
his
contempt
shall
not
be
bruising
to
you
when
he
hath
power
to
crush
why
had
your
bodies
no
heart
among
you
or
had
you
tongues
to
cry
against
the
rectorship
of
judgment
sicinius
have
you
ere
now
denied
the
asker
and
now
again
of
him
that
did
not
ask
but
mock
bestow
your
sudfor
tongues
third
citizen
hes
not
confirmd
we
may
deny
him
yet
second
citizens
and
will
deny
him
ill
have
five
hundred
voices
of
that
sound
first
citizen
i
twice
five
hundred
and
their
friends
to
piece
em
brutus
get
you
hence
instantly
and
tell
those
friends
they
have
chose
a
consul
that
will
from
them
take
their
liberties
make
them
of
no
more
voice
than
dogs
that
are
as
often
beat
for
barking
as
therefore
kept
to
do
so
sicinius
let
them
assemble
and
on
a
safer
judgment
all
revoke
your
ignorant
election
enforce
his
pride
and
his
old
hate
unto
you
besides
forget
not
with
what
contempt
he
wore
the
humble
weed
how
in
his
suit
he
scornd
you
but
your
loves
thinking
upon
his
services
took
from
you
th
apprehension
of
his
present
portance
which
most
gibingly
ungravely
he
did
fashion
after
the
inveterate
hate
he
bears
you
brutus
lay
a
fault
on
us
your
tribunes
that
we
labourd
no
impediment
between
but
that
you
must
cast
your
election
on
him
sicinius
say
you
chose
him
more
after
our
commandment
than
as
guided
by
your
own
true
affections
and
that
your
minds
preoccupied
with
what
you
rather
must
do
than
what
you
should
made
you
against
the
grain
to
voice
him
consul
lay
the
fault
on
us
brutus
ay
spare
us
not
say
we
read
lectures
to
you
how
youngly
he
began
to
serve
his
country
how
long
continued
and
what
stock
he
springs
of
the
noble
house
o
th
marcians
from
whence
came
that
ancus
marcius
numas
daughters
son
who
after
great
hostilius
here
was
king
of
the
same
house
publius
and
quintus
were
that
our
best
water
brought
by
conduits
hither
and
censorinus
nobly
named
so
twice
being
by
the
people
chosen
censor
was
his
great
ancestor
sicinius
one
thus
descended
that
hath
beside
well
in
his
person
wrought
to
be
set
high
in
place
we
did
commend
to
your
remembrances
but
you
have
found
scaling
his
present
bearing
with
his
past
that
hes
your
fixed
enemy
and
revoke
your
sudden
approbation
brutus
say
you
neer
had
donet
harp
on
that
still
but
by
our
putting
on
and
presently
when
you
have
drawn
your
number
repair
to
th
capitol
citizens
will
will
so
almost
all
repent
in
their
election

brutus
let
them
go

were
better
put
in
hazard
than
stay
past
doubt
for
greater
if
as
his

is
he
fall
in
rage
with
their
refusal
both
observe
and
answer
the
vantage
of
his
anger

come
we
will
be
there

what
his
choler
coriolanus
choler
were
i
as
patient
as
the
midnight
sleep
by
jove
twould
be
my
mind
sicinius
it
is
a
mind
that
shall
remain
a
poison
where
it
is
not
poison
any
further
coriolanus
shall
remain
hear
you
this
triton
of
the
minnows
mark
you
his
absolute
shall
cominius
twas
from
the
canon
coriolanus
shall
o
good
but
most
unwise
patricians
why
you
grave
but
reckless
senators
have
you
thus
given
hydra
here
to
choose
an
officer
that
with
his
peremptory
shall
being
but
the
horn
and
noise
o
th
monsters
wants
not
spirit
to
say
hell
turn
your
current
in

ditch
and
make
your
channel

if
he
have
power
then
vail
your
ignorance
if
none
awake
your
dangerous
lenity
if
you
are
learnd
be
not
as
common
fools
if
you
are
not
let
them
have
cushions
by
you
you
are
plebeians
if
they
be
senators
and
they
are
no
less
when
both
your
voices
blended
the
greatst
taste
most
palates
theirs
they
choose
their
magistrate
and
such
a
one
as
he
who
puts
his
shall
his
popular
shall
against
a
graver
bench
than
ever
frownd
in
greece
by
jove
himself
it
makes
the
consuls
base
and
my
soul
aches
to
know
when
two
authorities
are
up
neither
supreme
how
soon
confusion
may
enter
twixt
the
gap
of
both
and
take
the
one
by
th
other
cominius
well
on
to
th
marketplace
coriolanus
whoever
gave
that
counsel
to
give
forth
the
corn
o
th
storehouse
gratis
as
twas
usd
sometime
in
greece
menenius
well
well
no
more
of
that
coriolanus
though
there
the
people
had
more
absolute
powr
i
say
they
nourishd
disobedience
fed
the
ruin
of
the
state
brutus
why
shall
the
people
give
one
that
speaks
thus
their
voice
coriolanus
ill
give
my
reasons
more
worthier
than
their
voices
they
know
the
corn
was
not
our
recompense
resting
well
assurd
they
neer
did
service
fort
being
pressd
to
th
war
even
when
the
navel
of
the
state
was
touchd
they
would
not
thread
the
gates
this
kind
of
service
did
not
deserve
corn
gratis
being
i
th
war
their
mutinies
and
revolts
wherein
they
showd
most
valour
spoke
not
for
them
th
accusation
which
they
have
often
made
against
the
senate
all
cause
unborn
could
never
be
the
native
of
our
so
frank
donation
well
what
then
how
shall
this
bosom
multiplied
digest
the
senates
courtesy
let
deeds
express
whats
like
to
be
their
words
we
did
request
it
we
are
the
greater
poll
and
in
true
fear
they
gave
us
our
demands
thus
we
debase
the
nature
of
our
seats
and
make
the
rabble
call
our
cares
fears
which
will
in
time
break
ope
the
locks
o
th
senate
and
bring
in
the
crows
to
peck
the
eagles
menenius
come
enough
brutus
enough
with
over
measure
coriolanus
no
take
more
what
may
be
sworn
by
both
divine
and
human
seal
what
i
end
withal
this
double
worship
where
one
part
does
disdain
with
cause
the
other
insult
without
all
reason
where
gentry
title
wisdom
cannot
conclude
but
by
the
yea
and
no
of
general
ignorance
it
must
omit
real
necessities
and
give
way
the
while
to
unstable
slightness
purpose
so
barrd
it
follows
nothing
is
done
to
purpose
therefore
beseech
you
you
that
will
be
less
fearful
than
discreet
that
love
the
fundamental
part
of
state
more
than
you
doubt
the
change
ont
that
prefer
a
noble
life
before
a
long
and
wish
to
jump
a
body
with
a
dangerous
physic
thats
sure
of
death
without
it
at
once
pluck
out
the
multitudinous
tongue
let
them
not
lick
the
sweet
which
is
their
poison
your
dishonour
mangles
true
judgment
and
bereaves
the
state
of
that
integrity
which
should
becomet
not
having
the
power
to
do
the
good
it
would
for
th
ill
which
doth

brutus
has
said
enough
sicinius
has
spoken
like
a

shall
answer

thee
what
should
the

obedience

to
the
greater

in
a

when
whats

two
the
which
shall
turn
you
to
no

than
so
much
loss
of

sicinius
speak
briefly
then
for
we
are
peremptory
to
dispatch
this
viperous
traitor
to
eject
him
hence
were
but
one
danger
and
to
keep
him
here
our
certain
death
therefore
it
is
decreed
he
dies
tonight

now
the

forbid
that
our
renowned

should

off

easy
what
has
he
done
to

thats
worthy
death
killing
our
enemies
the
blood
he
hath
lost
which
i
dare
vouch
is
more
than
that
he
hath
by
many
an
ounce
he
dropt
it
for
his

and
what
is
left
to
lose
it
by

all
that

sicinius
this
is
clean
kam
brutus
merely
awry
when
he
did
love
his

it
honourd
him
sicinius
the
service
of
the
foot
being
once
gangrend
is
not
then
respected
for
what
before
it
was
brutus
well
hear
no
more
pursue
him
to
his
house
and
pluck
him
thence
lest
his
infection
being
of
catching
nature
spread
further
menenius
one
word
more
one
word
this
tigerfooted
rage
when
it
shall
find
the
harm
of
unscannd

enter
coriolanus

coriolanus
let
them
pull
all
about
mine
ears
present
me
death
on
the
wheel
or
at
wild
horses
heels
or
pile
ten
hills
on
the
tarpeian
rock
that
the
precipitation
might
down
stretch
below

yet
will
i
still
be
thus
to
them
first
patrician
you
do
the
nobler
coriolanus
i
muse
my
mother
does
not
approve
me
further
who
was
wont
to
call
them
woollen
vassals
things
created
to
buy
and
sell
with
groats
to
show
bare
heads
in
congregations
to
yawn
be
still
and
wonder
when
one
but
of
my
ordinance
stood
up
to
speak
of
peace
or
war

enter
volumnia

i
talk
of
you
why
did
you
wish
me
milder
would
you
have
me
false
to
my
nature
rather
say
i
play
the
man
i
am
volumnia
o
sir
sir
sir
i
would
have
had
you
put
your
power
well
on
before
you
had
worn
it
out
coriolanus
let
go
volumnia
you
might
have
been
enough
the
man
you
are
with
striving
less
to
be
so
lesser
had
been
the
thwartings
of
your
dispositions
if
you
had
not
showd
them
how
ye
were
disposd
ere
they
lackd
power
to
cross
you
coriolanus
let
them
hang
volumnia
ay
and
burn
too

enter
menenius
with
the
senators

menenius
come
come
you
have
been
too
rough
something
too
rough
you
must
return
and
mend
it
first
senator
theres
no
remedy
unless
by
not
so
doing
our
good
city
cleave
in
the
midst
and
perish
volumnia
pray
be
counselld
i
have
a
heart
as
little
apt
as
yours
but
yet
a
brain
that
leads
my
use
of
anger
to
better
vantage
menenius
well
said
noble
woman
before
he
should
thus
stoop
to
th
herd
but
that
the
violent
fit
o
th
time
craves
it
as
physic
for
the
whole
state
i
would
put
mine
armour
on
which
i
can
scarcely
bear
coriolanus
what
must
i
do
menenius
return
to
th
tribunes
coriolanus
well
what
then
what
then
menenius
repent
what
you
have
spoke
coriolanus
for
them
i
cannot
do
it
to
the
gods
must
i
then
dot
to
them
volumnia
you
are
too
absolute
though
therein
you
can
never
be
too
noble
but
when
extremities
speak
i
have
heard
you
say
honour
and
policy
like
unseverd
friends
i
th
war
do
grow
together
grant
that
and
tell
me
in
peace
what
each
of
them
by
th
other
lose
that
they
combine
not
there
coriolanus
tush
tush
menenius
a
good
demand
volumnia
if
it
be
honour
in
your
wars
to
seem
the
same
you
are
not
which
for
your
best
ends
you
adopt
your
policy
how
is
it
less
or
worse
that
it
shall
hold
companionship
in
peace
with
honour
as
in
war
since
that
to
both
it
stands
in
like
request
coriolanus
why
force
you
this
volumnia
because
that
now
it
lies
you
on
to
speak
to
th
people
not
by
your
own
instruction
nor
by
th
matter
which
your
heart
prompts
you
but
with
such
words
that
are
but
roted
in
your
tongue
though
but
bastards
and
syllables
of
no
allowance
to
your
bosoms
truth
now
this
no
more
dishonours
you
at
all
than
to
take
in
a
town
with
gentle
words
which
else
would
put
you
to
your
fortune
and
the
hazard
of
much
blood
i
would
dissemble
with
my
nature
where
my
fortunes
and
my
friends
at
stake
requird
i
should
do
so
in
honour
i
am
in
this
your
wife
your
son
these
senators
the
nobles
and
you
will
rather
show
our
general
louts
how
you
can
frown
than
spend
a
fawn
upon
em
for
the
inheritance
of
their
loves
and
safeguard
of
what
that
want
might
ruin
menenius
noble
lady
come
go
with
us
speak
fair
you
may
salve
so
not
what
is

the

of
what
is
past

i
prithee
now
my

go
to
them
with

in
thy

and
thus
far
having
stretchd
it
here
be
with
them
thy

bussing
the

for
in
such
busines
action
is
eloquence
and
the
eyes
of
th
ignorant
more
learned
than
the
ears
waving
thy
head
which
often
thus
correcting
thystout
heart
now
humble
as
the
ripest
mulberry
that
will
not
hold

say
to

thou

being

in

hast
not
the
soft
way
which
thou
dost
confess
were
fit
for
thee
to
use
as
they
to
claim

thou
wilt
frame
thyself
forsooth
hereafter
theirs
so
far
as
thou
hast
power
and
person
menenius
this
but
done
even
as

why
their

were
yours
for
they

go

ho
coriolanus

be
chargd
no
further
than
this
present
must
all
determine
here
sicinius
i
do
demand
if
you
submit
you
to
the
peoples
voices
allow
their
officers
and
are
content
to
suffer
lawful
censure
for
such
faults
as
shall
be
provd
upon
you
coriolanus
i
am
content
menenius
lo
citizens
he
says
he
is
content
the
warlike
service
he
has
done
consider
think
upon
the
wounds
his
body
bears
which
show
like
graves
i
th
holy
churchyard
coriolanus
scratches
with
briers
scars
to
move
laughter
only
menenius
consider
further
that
when
he
speaks
not
like
a
citizen
you
find
him
like
a
soldier
do
not
take
his
rougher
accents
for
malicious
sounds
but
as
i
say
such
as
become
a
soldier
rather
than
envy
you
cominius
well
well
no
more
coriolanus
what
is
the
matter
that
being
passd
for
consul
with
full
voice
i
am
so
dishonourd
that
the
very
hour
you
take
it
off
again
sicinius
answer
to
us
coriolanus
say
then
tis
true
i
ought
so
sicinius
we
charge
you
that
you
have
contrivd
to
take
from
rome
all
seasond
office
and
to
wind
yourself
into
a
power
tyrannical
for
which
you
are
a
traitor
to
the
people
coriolanus
how
traitor
menenius
nay
temperately
your
promise
coriolanus
the
fires
i
th
lowest
hell
fold
in
the
people
call
me
their
traitor
thou
injurious
tribune
within
thine
eyes
sat
twenty
thousand
deaths
in
thy
hands
clutchd
as
many
millions
in
thy
lying
tongue
both
numbers
i
would
say
thou
liest
unto
thee
with
a
voice
as
free
as
i
do
pray
the
gods
sicinius
mark
you
this
people
plebeians
to
th
rock
to
th
rock
with
him
sicinius
peace
we
need
not
put
new
matter
to
his
charge
what
you
have
seen
him
do
and
heard
him
speak
beating
your
officers
cursing
yourselves
opposing
laws
with
strokes
and
here
defying
those
whose
great
power
must
try
him
even
this
so
criminal
and
in
such
capital
kind
deserves
th
extremest
death
brutus
but
since
he
hath
servd
well
for
rome
coriolanus
what
do
you
prate
of
service
brutus
i
talk
of
that
that
know
it
coriolanus
you
menenius
is
this
the
promise
that
you
made
your
mother
cominius
know
i
pray
you
coriolanus
ill
know
no
further
let
them
pronounce
the
steep
tarpeian
death
vagabond
exile
flaying
pent
to
linger
but
with
a
grain
a
day
i
would
not
buy
their
mercy
at
the
price
of
one
fair
word
nor
check
my
courage
for
what
they
can
give
to
havet
with
saying
good
morrow
sicinius
for
that
he
has
as
much
as
in
him
lies
from
time
to
time
envied
against
the
people
seeking
means
to
pluck
away
their
power
as
now
at
last
given
hostile
strokes
and
that
not
in
the
presence
of
dreaded
justice
but
on
the
ministers
that
do
distribute
it
in
the
name
o
th
people
and
in
the
power
of
us
the
tribunes
we
evn
from
this
instant
banish

for

myself
aufidius
what
is
thy
name
coriolanus
a
name
unmusical
to
the
volscians
ears
and
harsh
in
sound
to
thine
aufidius
say
whats
thy
name
thou
has
a
grim
appearance
and
thy
face
bears
a
command
int
though
thy
tackles
torn
thou
showst
a
noble
vessel
whats
thy
name
coriolanus
prepare
thy
brow
to
frown
knowst
thou
me
yet
aufidius
i
know
thee
not
thy
name
coriolanus
my
name
is
caius
marcius
who
hath
done
to
thee
particularly
and
to
all
the
volsces
great
hurt
and
mischief
thereto
witness
may
my
surname
coriolanus
the
painful
service
the
extreme
dangers
and
the
drops
of
blood
shed
for
my
thankless
country
are
requited
but
with
that
surname
a
good
memory
and
witness
of
the
malice
and
displeasure
which
thou
shouldst
bear
me
only
that
name
remains
the
cruelty
and
envy
of
the
people
permitted
by
our
dastard
nobles
who
have
all
forsook
me
hath
devourd
the
rest
an
sufferd
me
by
th
voice
of
slaves
to
be
whoopd
out
of
rome
now
this
extremity
hath
brought
me
to
thy
hearth
not
out
of
hope
mistake
me
not
to
save
my
life
for
if
i
had
feard
death
of
all
the
men
i
th
world
i
would
have
voided
thee
but
in
mere
spite
to
be
full
quit
of
those
my
banishers
stand
i
before
thee
here
then
if
thou
hast
a
heart
of
wreak
in
thee
that
wilt
revenge
thine
own
particular
wrongs
and
stop
those
maims
of
shame
seen
through
thy
country
speed
thee
straight
and
make
my
misery
serve
thy
turn
so
use
it
that
my
revengeful
services
may
prove
as
benefits
to
thee
for
i
will
fight
against
my
cankred
country
with
the
spleen
of
all
the
under
fiends
but
if
so
be
thou
darst
not
this
and
that
to
prove
more
fortunes
thart
tird
then
in
a
word
i
also
am
longer
to
live
most
weary
and
present
my
throat
to
thee
and
to
thy
ancient
malice
which
not
to
cut
would
show
thee
but
a
fool
since
i
have
ever
followed
thee
with
hate
drawn
tuns
of
blood
out
of
thy
countrys
breast
and
cannot
live
but
to
thy
shame
unless
it
be
to
do
thee
service
aufidius
o
marcius
marcius
each
word
thou
hast
spoke
hath
weeded
from
my
heart
a
root
of
ancient
envy
if
jupiter
should
from
yond
cloud
speak
divine
things
and
say
tis
true
id
not
believe
them
more
than
thee
all
noble
marcius
let
me
twine
mine
arms
about
that
body
where
against
my
grained
ash
an
hundred
times
hath
broke
and
scarrd
the
moon
with
splinters
here
i
clip
the
anvil
of
my
sword
and
do
contest
as
hotly
and
as
nobly
with
thy
love
as
ever
in
ambitious
strength
i
did
contend
against
thy
valour
know
thou
first
i
lovd
the
maid
i
married
never
man
sighd
truer
breath
but
that
i
see
thee
here
thou
noble
thing
more
dances
my
rapt
heart
than
when
i
first
my
wedded
mistress
saw
bestride
my
threshold
why
thou
mars
i
tell
the
we
have
a
power
on
foot
and
i
had
purpose
once
more
to
hew
thy
target
from
thy
brawn
or
lose
mine
arm
fort
thou
hast
beat
me
out
twelve
several
times
and
i
have
nightly
since
dreamt
of
encounters
twixt
thyself
and
me
we
have
been
down
together
in
my
sleep
unbuckling
helms
fisting
each
others
throat
and
wakd
half
dead
with
nothing
worthy
marcius
had
we
no
other
quarrel
else
to
rome
but
that
thou
art
thence
banishd
we
would
muster
all
from
twelve
to
seventy
and
pouring
war
into
the
bowels
of
ungrateful
rome
like
a
bold
flood
oerbeat
o
come
go
in
and
take
our
friendly
senators
by
th
hands
who
now
are
here
taking
their
leaves
of
me
who
am
prepard
against
your
territories
though
not
for
rome
itself
coriolanus
you
bless
me
gods
aufidius
therefore
most
absolute
sir
if
thou
wilt
have
the
leading
of
thine
own
revenges
take
th
one
half
of
my
commission
and
set
down
as
best
thou
art
experiencd
since
thou
knowst
thy
countrys
strength
and
weakness
thine
own
ways
whether
to
knock
against
the
gates
of
rome
or
rudely
visit
them
in
parts
remote
to
fright
them
ere
destroy
but
come
in
let
me
commend
thee
first
to
those
that
shall
say
yea
to
thy
desires
a
thousand
welcomes
and
more
a
friend
than
eer
an
enemy
yet
marcius
that
was
much
your
hand
most
welcome
exeunt
coriolanus
and
aufidius

the
two
servingmen
come
forward

first
servant
heres
a
strange
alteration
second
servant
by
my
hand
i
had
thought
to
have
strucken
him
with
a
cudgel
and
yet
my
mind
gave
me
his
clothes
made
a
false
report
of
him
first
servant
what
an
arm
he
has
he
turnd
me
about
with
his
finger
and
his
thumb
as
one
would
set
up
a
top
second
servant
nay
i
knew
by
his
face
that
there
was
something
in
him
he
had
sir
a
kind
of
face
methought
i
cannot
tell
how
to
term
it
first
servant
he
had
so
looking
as
it
were
would
i
were
hangd
but
i
thought
there
was
more
in
him
than
i
could
think
second
servant
so
did
i
ill
be
sworn
he
is
simply
the
rarest
man
i
th
world
first
servant
i
think
he
is
but
a
greater
soldier
than
he
you
wot
on
second
servant
who
my
master
first
servant
nay
its
no
matter
for
that
second
servant
worth
six
on
him
first
servant
nay
not
so
neither
but
i
take
him
to
be
the
greater
soldier
second
servant
faith
look
you
one
cannot
tell
how
to
say
that
for
the
defence
of
a
town
our
general
is
excellent
first
servant
ay
and
for
an
assault
too

reenter
the
third
servingman

third
servant
o
slaves
i
can
tell
you
news
news
you
rascals
both
what
what
what
lets
partake
third
servant
i
would
not
be
a
roman
of
all
nations
i
had
as
lief
be
a
condemnd
man
both
wherefore
wherefore
third
servant
why
heres
he
that
was
wont
to
thwack
our
general
caius
marcius
first
servant
why
do
you
say
thwack
our
general
third
servant
i
do
not
say
thwack
our
general
but
he
was
always
good
enough
for
him
second
servant
come
we
are
fellows
and
friends
he
was
ever
too
hard
for
him
i
have
heard
him
say
so
himself
first
servant
he
was
too
hard
for
him
directly
to
say
the
troth
ont
before
corioli
he
scotchd
him
and
notchd
him
like
a
carbonado
second
servant
an
he
had
been
cannibally
given
he
might
have
broild
and
eaten
him
too
first
servant
but
more
of
thy
news
third
servant
why
he
is
so
made
on
here
within
as
if
he
were
son
and
heir
to
mars
set
at
upper
end
o
th
table
no
question
asked
him
by
any
of
the
senators
but
they
stand
bald
before
him
our
general
himself
makes
a
mistress
of
him
sanctifies
himself
withs
hand
and
turns
up
the
white
o
th
eye
to
his
discourse
but
the
bottom
of
the
news
is
our
general
is
cut
i
th
middle
and
but
one
half
of
what
he
was
yesterday
for
the
other
has
half
by
the
entreaty
and
grant
of
the
whole
table
hell
go
he
says
and
sowl
the
porter
of
rome
gates
by
th
ears
he
will
mow
all
down
before
him
and
leave
his
passage
polld
second
servant
and
hes
as
like
to
dot
as
any
man
i
can
imagine
third
servant
dot
he
will
dot
for
look
you
sir
he
has
as
many
friends
as
enemies
which
friends
sir
as
it
were
durst
not
look
you
sir
show
themselves
as
we
term
it
his
friends
whilst
hes
in
directitude
first
servant
directitude
whats
that
third
servant
but
when
they
shall
see
sir
his
crest
up
again
and
the
man
in
blood
they
will
out
of
their
burrows
like
conies
after
rain
and
revel
an
with
him
first
servant
but
when
goes
this
forward
third
servant
tomorrow
today
presently
you
shall
have
the
drum
struck
up
this
afternoon
tis
as
it
were
parcel
of
their
feast
and
to
be
executed
ere
they
wipe
their
lips
second
servant
why
then
we
shall
have
a
stirring
world
again
this
peace
is
nothing
but
to
rust
iron
increase
tailors
and
breed
balladmakers
first
servant
let
me
have
war
say
i
it
exceeds
peace
as
far
as
day
does
night
its
spritely
waking
audible
and
full
of
vent
peace
is
a
very
apoplexy
lethargy
mulld
deaf
sleepy
insensible
a
getter
of
more
bastard
children
than
wars
a
destroyer
of
men
second
servant
tis
so
and
as
war
in
some
sort
may
be
said
to
be
a
ravisher
so
it
cannot
be
denied
but
peace
is
a
great
maker
of
cuckolds
first
servant
ay
and
it
makes
men
hate
one
another
third
servant
reason
because
they
then
less
need
one
another
the
wars
for
my
money
i
hope
to
see
romans
as
cheap
as
volscians
they
are
rising
they
are
rising
both
in
in
in
in

cominius
who
shall
ask

the

cannot

if
they
should

be
good

cominius
but
i

theyll
roar
him
in

tullus
aufidius
the

scene
vii
a
camp
at
a
short
distance
from
rome

enter
aufidius
with
his
lieutenant

aufidius
do
they
still
fly
to
th
roman
lieutenant
i
do
not
know
what
witchcrafts
in
him
but
your
soldiers
use
him
as
the
grace
fore
meat
their
talk
at
table
and
their
thanks
at
end
and
you
are
darkned
in
this
action
sir
even
by
your
own
aufidius
i
cannot
help
it
now
unless
by
using
means
i
lame
the
foot
of
our
design
he
bears
himself
more
proudlier
even
to
my
person
than
i
thought
he
would
when
first
i
did
embrace
him
yet
his
nature
in
thats
no
changeling
and
i
must
excuse
what
cannot
be
amended
lieutenant
yet
i
wish
sir
i
mean
for
your
particular
you
had
not
joind
in
commission
with
him
but
either
had
borne
the
action
of
yourself
or
else
to
him
had
left
it
solely
aufidius
i
understand
thee
well
and
be
thou
sure
when
he
shall
come
to
his
account
he
knows
not
what
i
can
urge
against
him
although
it
seems
and
so
he
thinks
and
is
no
less
apparent
to
th
vulgar
eye
that
he
bears
all
things
fairly
and
shows
good
husbandry
for
the
volscian
state
fights
dragonlike
and
does
achieve
as
soon
as
draw
his
sword
yet
he
hath
left
undone
that
which
shall
break
his
neck
or
hazard
mine
wheneer
we
come
to
our
account
lieutenant
sir
i
beseech
you
think
you
hell
carry
rome
aufidius
all
places
yield
to
him
ere
he
sits
down
and
the
nobility
of
rome
are
his
the
senators
and
patricians
love
him
too
the
tribunes
are
no
soldiers
and
their
people
will
be
as
rash
in
the
repeal
as
hasty
to
expel
him
thence
i
think
hell
be
to
rome
as
is
the
osprey
to
the
fish
who
takes
it
by
sovereignty
of
nature
first
he
was
a
noble
servant
to
them
but
he
could
not
carry
his
honours
even
whether
twas
pride
which
out
of
daily
fortune
ever
taints
the
happy
man
whether
defect
of
judgment
to
fail
in
the
disposing
of
those
chances
which
he
was
lord
of
or
whether
nature
not
to
be
other
than
one
thing
not
moving
from
th
casque
to
th
cushion
but
commanding
peace
even
with
the
same
austerity
and
garb
as
he
controlld
the
war
but
one
of
these
as
he
hath
spices
of
them
all
not
all
for
i
dare
so
far
free
him
made
him
feard
so
hated
and
so
banishd
but
he
has
a
merit
to
choke
it
in
the
uttrance
so
our
virtues
lie
in
th
interpretation
of
the
time
and
power
unto
itself
most
commendable
hath
not
a
tomb
so
evident

one

drives

what
he
hath
said
which
was
sometime
his
general
who
lovd
him
in
a
most
dear
particular
he
calld
me
father
but
what
o
that
go
you
that
banishd
him
a
mile
before
his
tent
fall
down
and
knee

way
into
his
mercy
nay
if

to
hear
cominius

ill
keep
at

cominius
he
would
not
seem
to
know
me
menenius
do
you
hear
cominius
yet
one
time
he
did
call
me
by
my
name
i
urgd
our
old
acquaintance
and
the
drops
that
we
have
bled
together
coriolanus
he
would
not
answer
to
forbid
all
names
he
was
a
kind
of
nothing
titleless
till
he
had
forgd
himself
a
name
i
th
fire
of
burning
rome
menenius
why
so
you
have
made
good
work
a
pair
of
tribunes
that
have
wrackd
for
rome
to
make
coals
cheap
a
noble
memory
cominius
i
minded
him
how
royal
twas
to
pardon
when
it
was
less
expected
he
replied
it
was
a
bare
petition
of
a
state
to
one
whom
they
had
punishd
menenius
very
well
could
he
say
less
cominius
i
offerd
to
awaken
his
regard
fors
private
friends
his
answer
to
me
was
he
could
not
stay
to
pick
them
in
a
pile
of
noisome
musty
chaff
he
said
twas
folly
for
one
poor
grain
or
two
to
leave
unburnt
and
still
to
nose
th
offence
menenius
for
one
poor
grain
or
two
i
am
one
of
those
his
mother
wife
his
child
and
this
brave
fellow
too
we
are
the
grains
you
are
the
musty
chaff
and
you
are
smelt
above
the
moon
we
must
be
burnt
for
you
sicinius
nay
pray
be
patient
if
you
refuse
your
aid
in
this
so
neverneeded
help
yet
do
not
upbraids
with
our
distress
but
sure
if
you
would
be
your
countrys
pleader
your
good
tongue
more
than
the
instant
army
we
can
make
might
stop
our
countryman
menenius
no
ill
not
meddle
sicinius
pray
you
go
to
him
menenius
what
should
i
do
brutus
only
make
trial
what
your
love
can
do
for
rome
towards
marcius
menenius
well
and
say
that
marcius
return
me
as
cominius
is
returnd
unheard
what
then
but
as
a
discontented
friend
griefshot
with
his
unkindness
sayt
be
so
sicinius
yet
your
good
will
must
have
that
thanks
from
rome
after
the
measure
as
you
intended
well
menenius
ill
undertaket
i
think
hell
hear
me
yet
to
bite
his
lip
and
hum
at
good
cominius
much
unhearts
me
he
was
not
taken
well
he
had
not
dind
the
veins
unfilld
our
blood
is
cold
and
then
we
pout
upon
the
morning
are
unapt
to
give
or
to
forgive
but
when
we
have
stuffd
these
pipes
and
these
conveyances
of
our
blood
with
wine
and
feeding
we
have
suppler
souls
than
in
our
priestlike
fasts
therefore
ill
watch
him
till
he
be
dieted
to
my
request
and
then
ill
set
upon
him
brutus
you
know
the
very
road
into
his
kindness
and
cannot
lose
your
way
menenius
good
faith
ill
prove
him
speed
how
it
will
i
shall
ere
long
have
knowledge
of
my
success









































exit

gaoler
to
his
pity
i
kneeld
before
him
twas
very
faintly
he
said
rise
dismissd
me
thus
with
his
speechless
hand
what
he
would
do
he
sent
in
writing
after
me
what
he
would
not
bound
with
an
oath
to
yield
to
his
conditions
so
that
all
hope
is
vain
unless
his
noble
mother
and
his
wife
who
as
i
hear
mean
to
solicit
him
for
mercy
to
his
country
therefore
lets
hence
and
with
our
fair
entreaties
haste
them
on

but
by
your
leave
i
am
an
officer
of
state
and
come
to
speak
with
coriolanus
first
watch
from
whence
menenius
from
rome
first
watch
you
may
not
pass
you
must
return
our
general
will
no
more
hear
from
thence
second
watch
youll
see
your
rome
embracd
with
fire
before
youll
speak
with
coriolanus
menenius
good
my
friends
if
you
have
heard
your
general
talk
of
rome
and
of
his
friends
there
it
is
lots
to
blanks
my
name
hath
touchd
your
ears
it
is
menenius
first
watch
be
it
so
go
back
the
virtue
of
your
name
is
not
here
passable
menenius
i
tell
thee
fellow
thy
general
is
my
lover
i
have
been
the
book
of
his
good
acts
whence
men
have
read
his
fame
unparalleld
haply
amplified
for
i
have
ever
verified
my
friends
of
whom
hes
chief
with
all
the
size
that
verity
would
without
lapsing
suffer
nay
sometimes
like
to
a
bowl
upon
a
subtle
ground
i
have
tumbled
past
the
throw
and
in
his
praise
have
almost
stampd
the
leasing
therefore
fellow
i
must
have
leave
to
pass
first
watch
faith
sir
if
you
had
told
as
many
lies
in
his
behalf
as
you
have
uttered
words
in
your
own
you
should
not
pass
here
no
though
it
were
as
virtuous
to
lie
as
to
live
chastely
therefore
go
back
menenius
prithee
fellow
remember
my
name
is
menenius
always
factionary

party
of

been
his
liar
as
you
say
you
have
i
am

first
watch
you

a
roman
are
you
menenius
i
am
as
thy
general
is
first
watch
then
you
should
hate
rome
as
he
does
can
you
when
you
have
pushd
out
your
gates
the
very
defender
of
them
and
in
a
violent
popular
ignorance
given
your
enemy
your
shield
think
to
front
his
revenges
with
the
easy
groans
of
old
women
the
virginal
palms
of
your

aufidius
only

you
have

stoppd
your

i

lovd
me
above

indeed
their
latest
refuge
was
to

him
for

i

though
i
showd
sourly
to
him
once
more
offerd
the
first
conditions
which
they
did
refuse
and
cannot
now
accept
to

him
only
that

do
more
a
very

i

yielded
to
fresh
embassies

nor
from

do
not

no

no

you
have
said
you
will
not
grant
us
any
thing
for
we
have
nothing
else
to
ask
but
that
which
you
deny
already
yet
we
will
ask
that
if
you
fail
in
our
request
the
blame
may
hang
upon
your
hardness
therefore
hear
us

you

hear
nought
from

in

your

thou
must
as

determine

i
can
not

to

so
that
our

did
tend
to

thereby
to
destroy
the

you

you
might
condemn
us
as
poisonous
of
your

no

suit
is
that
you
reconcile

may
say
this

we
have
showd
the

we
receivd
and
each
in

be

for
making
up
this
peace
thou
knowst
great
son
the
end
of
wars
uncertain
but
this
certain
that
if
thou
conquer
rome
the
benefit
which
thou
shalt
thereby
reap
is
such
a
name
whose
repetition
will
be
doggd
with
curses
whose
chronicle
thus
writ
the
man
was
noble
but
with
his
last
attempt
he
wipd
it
out
destroyd
his

and
his

remains
to
th
ensuing
age
abhorrd
speak
to
me
son
thou
hast
affected
the
fine
strains
of
honour
to
imitate
the
graces
of
the
gods
to
tear
with
thunder
the
wide
cheeks
o
th
air
and
yet
to
charge
thy
sulphur
with
a
bolt
that
should
but
rive
an
oak
why
dost
not
speak
thinkst
thou
it
honourable
for
a
noble
man
still
to
remember
wrongs
daughter
speak
you
he
cares
not
for
your
weeping
speak
thou

perhaps
thy
childishness
will
move
him
more
than
can
our
reasons
theres
no
man
in
the
world
more
bound
tos
mother
yet
here
he
lets
me
prate
like
one
i
th
stocks
thou
hast
never
in

showd
thy

mother
any
courtesy
when
she
poor
hen
fond
of
no

brood
has
cluckd
thee
to
the

and
safely
home
loaden
with

if
it
he

thou
art
not
honest
and
the

will
plague
thee
that
thou
restrainst
from
me
the
duty
which
to
a
mothers
part
belongs
he
turns
away
down

let
us
shame
him
with
our

to
his

coriolanus
longs
more
pride
than

down

this
is
the
last
so
we
will
home

there
is
some
hope
the

his

prevail
with

but
i

there
is
no

int
our

sicinius
ist
possible
that
so
short
a

can
alter
the

of
a

menenius
there
is
differency
between

your

was
a

this
marcius
is

he

sicinius
he
lovd
his

he
is

to
pierce
a

with
his

talks
like
a

and
his
hum
is
a
battery
he
sits
in
his

as
a

made
for

what
he
bids
be

is

he
wants
nothing

yes

if
you
report

truly
menenius
i
paint
him
in

mark
what

his

shall
bring

there
is
no

in

there
is

all

most
welcome
first
conspirator
how
is
it
with

general
aufidius
even
so
as
with
a
man
by
his
own
alms
empoisond
and
with
his
charity
slain
second
conspirator
most
noble
sir
if
you
do
hold
the

intent
wherein
you
wishd
us
parties
well
deliver
you
of
your
great
danger
aufidius
sir
i
cannot
tell
we
must
proceed
as
we
do
find
the
people
third
conspirator
the
people
will
remain
uncertain
whilst
twixt
you
theres
difference
but
the
fall
of
either
makes
the
survivor
heir
of
all
aufidius
i
know
it
and
my
pretext
to
strike
at
him
admits
a
good
construction
i
raisd
him
and
i
pawnd
mine
honour
for
his
truth
who
being
so
heightend
he
watered
his
new
plants
with
dews
of
flattery
seducing
so
my
friends
and
to
this
end
he
bowd
his
nature
never
known
before
but
to
be
rough
unswayable
and
free
third
conspirator
sir
his
stoutness
when
he
did
stand
for
consul
which
he
lost
by
lack
of
stooping
aufidius
that
i
would
have
spoken
of
being
banishd
fort
he
came
unto
my
hearth
presented
to
my
knife
his
throat
i
took
him
made
him
jointservant
with
me
gave
him
way
in
all
his
own
desires
nay
let
him
choose
out
of
my
files
his
projects
to
accomplish
my
best
and
freshest
men
servd
his
designments
in
mine
own
person
holp
to
reap
the
fame
which
he
did
end
all
his
and
took
some
pride
to
do
myself
this
wrong
till
at
the
last
i
seemd
his
follower
not
partner
and
he
wagd
me
with
his
countenance
as
if
i
had
been
mercenary
first
conspirator
so
he
did
my
lord
the
army
marvelld
at
it
and
in
the
last
when
he
had
carried
rome
and
that
we
lookd
for
no
less
spoil
than
glory
aufidius
there
was
it
for
which
my
sinews
shall
be
stretchd
upon
him
at
a
few
drops
of
womens
rheum
which
are
as
cheap
as
lies
he
sold
the
blood
and
labour
of
our
great
action
therefore
shall
he
die
and
ill
renew
me
in
his
fall
but
hark
drums
and
trumpets
sound
with
great
shouts
of
the

first
conspirator
your

you

second
conspirator

patient
fools
whose
children
he
hath
slain
their
base
throats
tear
with
giving

feel
your
sword

enter
philario
iachimo
a
frenchman
a
dutchman
and
a
spaniard

iachimo
believe
it
sir
i
have
seen
him
in
britain
he
was
then
of
a
crescent
note
expected
to
prove
so
worthy
as
since
he
hath
been
allowed
the
name
of
but
i
could
then
have
lookd
on
him
without
the
help
of
admiration
though
the
catalogue
of
his
endowments
had
been
tabled
by
his
side
and
i
to
peruse
him
by
items
philario
you
speak
of
him
when
he
was
less
furnishd
than
now
he
is
with
that
which
makes
him
both
without
and
within
frenchman
i
have
seen
him
in
france
we
had
very
many
there
could
behold
the
sun
with
as
firm
eyes
as
he
iachimo
this
matter
of
marrying
his
kings
daughter
wherein
he
must
be
weighed
rather
by
her
value
than
his
own
words
him
i
doubt
not
a
great
deal
from
the
matter
frenchman
and
then
his
banishment
iachimo
ay
and
the
approbation
of
those
that
weep
this
lamentable
divorce
under
her
colours
are
wonderfully
to
extend
him
be
it
but
to
fortify
her
judgment
which
else
an
easy
battery
might
lay
flat
for
taking
a
beggar
without
less
quality
but
how
comes
it
he
is
to
sojourn
with
you
how
creeps
acquaintance
philario
his
father
and
i
were
soldiers
together
to
whom
i
have
been
often
bound
for
no
less
than
my
life

enter
posthumus

here
comes
the
briton
let
him
be
so
entertained
amongst
you
as
suits
with
gentlemen
of
your
knowing
to
a
stranger
of
his
quality
i
beseech
you
all
be
better
known
to
this
gentleman
whom
i
commend
to
you
as
a
noble
friend
of
mine
how
worthy
he
is
i
will
leave
to
appear
hereafter
rather
than
story
him
in
his
own
hearing
frenchman
sir
we
have
known
together
in
orleans
posthumus
since
when
i
have
been
debtor
to
you
for
courtesies
which
i
will
be
ever
to
pay
and
yet
pay
still
frenchman
sir
you
oerrate
my
poor
kindness
i
was
glad
i
did
atone
my
countryman
and
you
it
had
been
pity
you
should
have
been
put
together
with
so
mortal
a
purpose
as
then
each
bore
upon
importance
of
so
slight
and
trivial
a
nature
posthumus
by
your
pardon
sir
i
was
then
a
young
traveller
rather
shunnd
to
go
even
with
what
i
heard
than
in
my
every
action
to
be
guided
by
others
experiences
but
upon
my
mended
judgment
if
i
offend
not
to
say
it
is
mended
my
quarrel
was
not
altogether
slight
frenchman
faith
yes
to
be
put
to
the
arbitrement
of
swords
and
by
such
two
that
would
by
all
likelihood
have
confounded
one
the
other
or
have
falln
both
iachimo
can
we
with
manners
ask
what
was
the
difference
frenchman
safely
i
think
twas
a
contention
in
public
which
may
without
contradiction
suffer
the
report
it
was
much
like
an
argument
that
fell
out
last
night
where
each
of
us
fell
in
praise
of
our
country
mistresses
this
gentleman
at
that
time
vouching
and
upon
warrant
of
bloody
affirmation
his
to
be
more
fair
virtuous
wise
chaste
constant
qualified
and
less
attemptable
than
any
the
rarest
of
our
ladies
in
france
iachimo
that
lady
is
not
now
living
or
this
gentlemans
opinion
by
this
worn
out
posthumus
she
holds
her
virtue
still
and
i
my
mind
iachimo
you
must
not
so
far
prefer
her
fore
ours
of
italy
posthumus
being
so
far
provokd
as
i
was
in
france
i
would
abate
her
nothing
though
i
profess
myself
her
adorer
not
her
friend
iachimo
as
fair
and
as
good
a
kind
of
handinhand
comparison
had
been
something
too
fair
and
too
good
for
any
lady
in
britain
if
she
went
before
others
i
have
seen
as
that
diamond
of
yours
outlustres
many
i
have
beheld
i
could
not
but
believe
she
excelled
many
but
i
have
not
seen
the
most
precious
diamond
that
is
nor
you
the
lady
posthumus
i
praisd
her
as
i
rated
her
so
do
i
my
stone
iachimo
what
do
you
esteem
it
at
posthumus
more
than
the
world
enjoys
iachimo
either
your
unparagond
mistress
is
dead
or
shes
outprizd
by
a
trifle
posthumus
you
are
mistaken
the
one
may
be
sold
or
given
if
there
were
wealth
enough
for
the
purchase
or
merit
for
the
gift
the
other
is
not
a
thing
for
sale
and
only
the
gift
of
the
gods
iachimo
which
the
gods
have
given
you
posthumus
which
by
their
graces
i
will
keep
iachimo
you
may
wear
her
in
title
yours
but
you
know
strange
fowl
light
upon
neighbouring
ponds
your
ring
may
be
stoln
too
so
your
brace
of
unprizable
estimations
the
one
is
but
frail
and
the
other
casual
a
cunning
thief
or
a
thatwayaccomplishd
courtier
would
hazard
the
winning
both
of
first
and
last
posthumus
your
italy
contains
none
so
accomplishd
a
courtier
to
convince
the
honour
of
my
mistress
if
in
the
holding
or
loss
of
that
you
term
her
frail
i
do
nothing
doubt
you
have
store
of
thieves
notwithstanding
i

not
my

let

sir
with

this

i

makes
no

we
are

with

moiety
of
my
estate
to
your
ring
which
in
my
opinion
oervalues
it
something
but
i
make
my
wager
rather
against
your
confidence
than
her
reputation
and
to
bar
your
offence
herein
too
i
durst
attempt
it
against
any
lady
in
the
world
posthumus
you
are
a
great
deal
abusd
in
too
bold
a
persuasion
and
i
doubt
not
you
sustain
what
yare
worthy
of
by
your
attempt
iachimo
whats
that
posthumus
a
repulse
though
your
attempt
as
you
call
it
deserve
more
a
punishment
too
philario
gentlemen
enough
of
this
it
came
in
too
suddenly
let
it
die
as
it
was
born
and
i
pray
you
be
better
acquainted
iachimo
would
i
had
put
my
estate
and
my
neighbours
on
th
approbation
of
what
i
have
spoke
posthumus
what
lady
would
you
choose
to
assail
iachimo
yours
whom
in
constancy
you
think
stands
so
safe
i
will
lay
you
ten
thousand
ducats
to
your
ring
that
commend
me
to
the
court
where
your
lady
is
with
no
more
advantage
than
the
opportunity
of
a
second
conference
and
i
will
bring
from
thence
that
honour
of
hers
which
you
imagine
so
reservd
posthumus
i
will
wage
against
your
gold
gold
to
it
my
ring
i
hold
dear
as
my
finger
tis
part
of
it
iachimo
you
are
a
friend
and
therein
the
wiser
if
you
buy
ladies
flesh
at
a
million
a
dram
you
cannot
preserve
it
from
tainting
but
i
see
you
have
some
religion
in
you
that
you
fear
posthumus
this
is
but
a
custom
in
your
tongue
you
bear
a
graver
purpose
i
hope
iachimo
i
am
the
master
of
my
speeches
and
would
undergo
whats
spoken
i
swear
posthumus
will
you
i
shall
but
lend
my
diamond
till
your
return
let
there
be
covenants
drawn
betweens
my
mistress
exceeds
in
goodness
the
hugeness
of
your
unworthy
thinking
i
dare
you
to
this
match
heres
my
ring
philario
i
will
have
it
no
lay
iachimo
by
the
gods
it
is
one
if
i
bring
you
no
sufficient
testimony
that
i
have
enjoyd
the
dearest
bodily
part
of
your
mistress
my
ten
thousand
ducats
are
yours
so
is
your
diamond
too
if

her
in
such
honour
as
you
have
trust
in
she
your
jewel

your
jewel
and

prevaild

covenant
we
will
have
these

ay
here
they

madam
presenting
a
box
but
i
beseech
your
grace
without
offence
my
conscience
bids
me
ask
wherefore
you
have
commanded
of
me
these
most
poisonous
compounds
which
are
the
movers
of
a
languishing
death
but
though
slow
deadly

thou

thus

proceeded
unless
thou

me
devilish
ist
not

i

try
the
forces
of
these
thy
compounds
on
such
creatures
as
we
count
not
worth
the
hanging

none
human
to
try
the
vigour
of
them

apply
allayments
to
their

by

their
several
virtues

effects
cornelius
your

noisome

cornelius
aside
i

not

she

she

poisons
i
do

her
spirit
and
will
not
trust
one
of
her
malice
with
a
drug
of
such
damnd
nature
those
she

will
stupefy

of
envy
if
twere
made
comparative
for

of
any
penny
tribute

are
men
more
orderd
than
when
julius
caesar
smild
at
their
lack
of
skill
but
found
their
courage
worthy
his
frowning
at
their
discipline

they
are

the
swiftest

and
winds
of
all
the
comers
kissd
your
sails
to
make
your
vessel
nimble
philario
welcome
sir
posthumus
i
hope
the
briefness
of
your
answer
made
the
speediness
of
your
return
iachimo
your
lady
is
one
of
the
fairest
that
i
have
lookd
upon
posthumus
and
therewithal
the
best
or
let
her
beauty
look
through
a
casement
to
allure
false
hearts
and
be
false
with
them
iachimo
here
are
letters
for
you
posthumus
their
tenour
good
i
trust
iachimo
tis
very
like
philario
was
caius
lucius
in
the
britain
court
when
you
were
there
iachimo
he
was
expected
then
but
not
approachd
posthumus
all
is
well
yet
sparkles
this
stone
as
it
was
wont
or
ist
not
too
dull
for
your
good
wearing
iachimo
if
i
have
lost
it
i
should
have
lost
the
worth
of
it
in
gold
ill
make
a
journey
twice
as
far
t
enjoy
a
second
night
of
such
sweet
shortness
which
was
mine
in
britain
for
the
ring
is
won
posthumus
the
stones
too
hard
to
come
by
iachimo
not
a
whit
your
lady
being
so
easy
posthumus
make
not
sir
your
loss
your
sport
i
hope
you
know
that
we
must
not
continue
friends
iachimo
good
sir
we
must
if
you
keep
covenant
had
i
not
brought
the
knowledge
of
your
mistress
home
i
grant
we
were
to
question
farther
but
i
now
profess
myself
the
winner
of
her
honour
together
with
your
ring
and
not
the
wronger
of
her
or
you
having
proceeded
but
by
both
your
wills
posthumus
if
you
can
maket
apparent
that
you
have
tasted
her
in
bed
my
hand
and
ring
is
yours
if
not
the
foul
opinion
you
had
of
her
pure
honour
gains
or
loses
your
sword
or
mine
or
masterless
leaves
both
to
who
shall
find
them
iachimo
sir
my
circumstances
being
so
near
the
truth
as
i
will
make
them
must
first
induce
you
to
believe
whose
strength
i
will
confirm
with
oath
which
i
doubt
not
youll
give
me
leave
to
spare
when
you
shall
find
you
need
it
not
posthumus
proceed
iachimo
first
her
bedchamber
where
i
confess
i
slept
not
but
profess
had
that
was
well
worth
watchingit
was
hangd
with
tapestry
of
silk
and
silver
the
story
proud
cleopatra
when
she
met
her
roman
and
cydnus
swelld
above
the
banks
or
for
the
press
of
boats
or
pride
a
piece
of
work
so
bravely
done
so
rich
that
it
did
strive
in
workmanship
and
value
which
i
wonderd
could
be
so
rarely
and
exactly
wrought
since
the
true
life
ont
was
posthumus
this
is
true
and
this
you
might
have
heard
of
here
by
me
or
by
some
other
iachimo
more
particulars
must
justify
my
knowledge
posthumus
so
they
must
or
do
your
honour
injury
iachimo
the
chimney
is
south
the
chamber
and
the
chimneypiece
chaste
dian
bathing
never
saw
i
figures
so
likely
to
report
themselves
the
cutter
was
as
another
nature
dumb
outwent
her
motion
and
breath
left
out
posthumus
this
is
a
thing
which
you
might
from
relation
likewise
reap
being
as
it
is
much
spoke
of
iachimo
the
roof
o
th
chamber
with
golden
cherubins
is
fretted
her
andirons
i
had
forgot
them
were
two
winking
cupids
of
silver
each
on
one
foot
standing
nicely
depending
on
their
brands
posthumus
this
is
her
honour
let
it
be
granted
you
have
seen
all
this
and
praise
be
given
to
your
remembrance
the
description
of
what
is
in
her
chamber
nothing
saves
the
wager
you
have
laid
iachimo
then
if
you
can















shows
the
bracelet
be
pale
i
beg
but
leave
to
air
this
jewel
see
and
now
tis
up
again
it
must
be
married
to
that
your
diamond
ill
keep
them
posthumus
jove
once
more
let
me
behold
it
is
it
that
which
i
left
with
her
iachimo
sir
i
thank
her
that
she
strippd
it
from
her
arm
i
see
her
yet
her
pretty
action
did
outsell
her
gift
and
yet
enrichd
it
too
she
gave
it
me
and
said
she
prizd
it
once
posthumus
may
be
she
pluckd
it
of
to
send
it
me
iachimo
she
writes
so
to
you
doth
she
posthumus
o
no
no
no
tis
true
here
take
this
too
gives
the
ring
it
is
a
basilisk
unto
mine
eye
kills
me
to
look
ont
let
there
be
no
honour
where
there
is
beauty
truth
where
semblance
love
where
theres
another
man
the
vows
of
women
of
no
more
bondage
be
to
where
they
are
made
than
they
are
to
their
virtues
which
is
nothing
o
above
measure
false
philario
have
patience
sir
and
take
your
ring
again
tis
not
yet
won
it
may
be
probable
she
lost
it
or
who
knows
if
one
her
women
being
corrupted
hath
stoln
it
from
her
posthumus
very
true
and
so
i
hope
he
came
byt
back
my
ring
render
to
me
some
corporal
sign
about
her
more
evident
than
this
for
this
was
stoln
iachimo
by
jupiter
i
had
it
from
her
arm
posthumus
hark
you
he
swears
by
jupiter
he
swears
tis
true
nay
keep
the
ring
tis
true
i
am
sure
she
would
not
lose
it
her
attendants
are
all
sworn
and
honourable
they
inducd
to
steal
it
and
by
a
stranger
no
he
hath
enjoyd
her
the
cognizance
of
her
incontinency
is
this
she
hath
bought
the
name
of
whore
thus
dearly
there
take
thy
hire
and
all
the
fiends
of
hell
divide
themselves
between
you
philario
sir
be
patient
this
is
not
strong
enough
to
be
believd
of
one
persuaded
well
of
posthumus
never
talk
ont
she
hath
been
colted
by
him
iachimo
if
you
seek
for
further
satisfying
under
her
breast
worthy
the
pressing
lies
a
mole
right
proud
of
that
most
delicate
lodging
by
my
life
i
kissd
it
and
it
gave
me
present
hunger
to
feed
again
though
full
you
do
remember
this
stain
upon
her
posthumus
ay
and
it
doth
confirm
another
stain
as
big
as
hell
can
hold
were
there
no
more
but
it
iachimo
will
you
hear
more
posthumus
spare
your
arithmetic
never
count
the
turns
once
and
a
million
iachimo
ill
be
sworn
posthumus
no
swearing
if
you
will
swear
you
have
not
donet
you
lie
and
i
will
kill
thee
if
thou
dost
deny
thoust
made
me
cuckold
iachimo
ill
deny
nothing
posthumus
o
that
i
had
her
here
to
tear
her
limbmeal
i
will
go
there
and
dot
i
th
court
before
her
father
ill
do
something

quite
besides
the
government
of

you
have
won

cymbeline
now

what
would
augustus
caesar
with
us
lucius
when
julius
caesar
whose
remembrance
yet
lives
in
mens
eyes
and
will
to
ears
and
tongues
be
theme
and
hearing
ever
was
in
this
britain
and
conquerd
it
cassibelan
thine
uncle
famous
in
caesars
praises
no
whit
less
than
in
his
feats
deserving
it
for
him
and
his
succession
granted
rome
a
tribute
yearly
three
thousand
pounds
which
by
thee
lately
is
left
untenderd
queen
and
to
kill
the
marvel
shall
be
so
ever
cloten
there
be
many
caesars
ere
such
another
julius
britain
is
a
world
by
itself
and
we
will
nothing
pay
for
wearing
our
own
noses
queen
that
opportunity
which
then
they
had
to
take
from
s
to
resume
we
have
again
remember
sir
my
liege
the
kings
your
ancestors
together
with
the
natural
bravery
of
your
isle
which
stands
as
neptunes
park
ribbd
and
pald
in
with
rocks
unscalable
and
roaring
waters
with
sands
that
will
not
bear
your
enemies
boats
but
suck
them
up
to
th
topmast
a
kind
of
conquest
caesar
made
here
but
made
not
here
his
brag
of
came
and
saw
and
overcame
with
shame
the
first
that
ever
touchd
him
he
was
carried
from
off
our
coast
twice
beaten
and
his
shipping
poor
ignorant
baubles
on
our
terrible
seas
like
eggshells
movd
upon
their
surges
crackd
as
easily
gainst
our
rocks
for
joy
whereof
the
famd
cassibelan
who
was
once
at
point
o
giglot
fortune
to
master
caesars
sword
made
luds
town
with
rejoicing
fires
bright
and
britons
strut
with
courage
cloten
come
theres
no
more
tribute
to
be
paid
our
kingdom
is
stronger
than
it
was
at
that
time
and
as
i
said
there
is
no
moe
such
caesars
other
of
them
may
have
crookd
noses
but
to
owe
such
straight
arms
none
cymbeline
son
let
your
mother
end
cloten
we
have
yet
many
among
us
can
gripe
as
hard
as
cassibelan
i
do
not
say
i
am
one
but
i
have
a
hand
why
tribute
why
should
we
pay
tribute
if
caesar
can
hide
the
sun
from
us
with
a
blanket
or
put
the
moon
in
his
pocket
we
will
pay
him
tribute
for
light
else
sir
no
more
tribute
pray
you
now
cymbeline
you
must
know
till
the
injurious
romans
did
extort
this
tribute
from
us
we
were
free
caesars
ambition
which
swelld
so
much
that
it
did
almost
stretch
the
sides
o
th
world
against
all
colour
here
did
put
the
yoke
upons
which
to
shake
of
becomes
a
warlike
people
whom
we
reckon
ourselves
to
be
cloten
we
do
cymbeline
say
then
to
caesar
our
ancestor
was
that
mulmutius
which
ordaind
our
laws
whose
use
the
sword
of
caesar
hath
too
much
mangled
whose
repair
and
franchise
shall
by
the
power
we
hold
be
our
good
deed
though
rome
be
therefore
angry
mulmutius
made
our
laws
who
was
the
first
of
britain
which
did
put
his
brows
within
a
golden
crown
and
calld
himself
a
king
lucius
i
am
sorry
cymbeline
that
i
am
to
pronounce
augustus
caesar
caesar
that
hath
moe
kings
his
servants
than
thyself
domestic
officers
thine
enemy
receive
it
from
me
then
war
and
confusion
in
caesars
name
pronounce
i
gainst
thee
look
for
fury
not
to
be
resisted
thus
defied

for
myself

me
keep
at
utterance
i
am
perfect
that
the
pannonians
and
dalmatians
for
their
liberties
are
now
in
arms
a
precedent
which
not
to
read
would
show

not

lucius
let

a

this

instructs
you
how
t

and
bows
you
to
a

holy

the

it

you
may
then
revolve
what

i
have
told
you
of

of
the
tricks
in

this
service
is
not
service
so
being
done

being
so
allowd
to

thus
draws
us
a
profit
from
all
things
we
see
and
often
to
our
comfort
shall
we
find
the
sharded
beetle
in
a

o

nobler

we

of

when
a

was
the

my

in

a

call

guiderius
uncertain

belarius
my
fault
being
nothing
as
i
have
told
you
oft
but
that
two
villains
whose
false
oaths
prevaild
before
my
perfect
honour
swore
to

i
was
confederate
with
the

so
followd
my

ill

you

know
little
they

i

they

their

nature
prompts
them

the

thought

imogen
most
like
bringing
me
here
to
kill
me
pisanio
not
so
neither
but
if
i
were
as
wise
as
honest
then
my
purpose
would
prove
well
it
cannot
be
but
that
my
master
is
abusd
some
villain
ay
and
singular
in
his
art
hath
done
you
both
this
cursed
injury
imogen
some
roman
courtezan
pisanio
no
on
my
life
ill
give
but
notice
you
are
dead
and
send
him
some
bloody
sign
of
it
for
tis
commanded
i
should
do
so
you
shall
be
missd
at

and
that
will
well
confirm
it
imogen
why
good
fellow
what
shall
i
do

while
where
bide
how
live
or
in
my
life
what
comfort
when
i
am
dead
to
my
husband
pisanio
if
youll
back
to
th
court
imogen
no
court
no
father
nor
no
more
ado
with
that
harsh
noble
simple
nothing
that
cloten
whose
lovesuit
hath
been
to
me
as
fearful
as
a
siege
pisanio
if
not
at
court
then
not
in
britain
must
you
bide
imogen
where
then
hath
britain
all
the
sun
that
shines
day
night
are
they
not
but
in
britain
i
th
worlds
volume
our
britain
seems
as
of
it
but
not
int
in
a
great
pool
a
swans
nest
prithee
think
theres
livers
out
of
britain
pisanio
i
am
most
glad
you
think
of
other
place
th
ambassador
lucius
the
roman
comes
to
milford
haven
tomorrow
now
if
you
could
wear
a
mind
dark
as
your
fortune
is
and
but
disguise
that
which
t
appear
itself
must
not
yet
be
but
by
selfdanger
you
should
tread
a
course
pretty
and
full
of
view
yea
happily
near
the
residence
of
posthumus
so
nigh
at
least
that
though
his
actions
were
not
visible
yet
report
should
render
him
hourly
to
your
ear
as
truly
as
he
moves
imogen
o
for
such
means
though
peril
to
my
modesty
not
death
ont
i
would
adventure
pisanio
well
then
heres
the
point
you
must
forget
to
be
a
woman
change
command
into
obedience
fear
and
niceness
the
handmaids
of
all
women
or
more
truly
woman
it
pretty
self
into
a
waggish
courage
ready
in
gibes
quickanswerd
saucy
and
as
quarrelous
as
the
weasel
nay
you
must
forget
that
rarest
treasure
of
your
cheek
exposing
it
but
o
the
harder
heart
alack
no
remedy
to
the
greedy
touch
of
commonkissing
titan
and
forget
your
laboursome
and
dainty
trims
wherein
you
made
great
juno
angry
imogen
nay
be
brief
i
see
into
thy
end

why

you

sure
belarius
i
cannot
tell
long
is
it
since
i
saw
him
but
time
hath
nothing
blurrd
those
lines
of
favour
which
then
he
wore
the
snatches
in
his
voice
and
burst
of
speaking
were
as
his
i
am
absolute
twas
very
cloten
arviragus
in
this

we
left

i
wish
my

make
good
time
with

you
say
he

belarius
being

reenter

but
see
thy

guiderius
this
cloten
was
a
fool
an
empty
purse
there
was
no
money
int
not
hercules
could
have
knockd
out
his

for
he
had
none
yet
i
not
doing
this
the
fool
had
borne
my
head
as
i
do
his
belarius
what
hast
thou
done
guiderius
i
am
perfect
what
cut
off
one
clotens
head
son
to
the
queen
after
his
own
report
who
calld
me
traitor
mountaineer
and
swore
with
his

take

displace
our

where
thank
the
gods
they
grow
and
set
them
on

belarius
we
are
all
undone
guiderius
why
worthy
father
what
have
we
to
lose
but
that
he
swore
to
take
our
lives
the
law
protects
not
us
then
why
should
we
be
tender
to
let
an
arrogant
piece
of
flesh
threat
us
play
judge
and
executioner
all
himself
for
we
do
fear
the
law
what
company
discover
you
abroad
belarius
no
single
soul
can
we
set
eye
on
but
in
an
safe
reason
he
must
have
some
attendants
though
his
humour
was
nothing
but
mutation
ay
and
that
from
one
bad
thing
to
worse
not
frenzy
not
absolute
madness
could
so
far
have
ravd
to
bring
him
here
alone
although
perhaps
it
may
be
heard
at
court
that
such
as
we
cave
here
hunt
here
are
outlaws
and
in
time
may
make
some
stronger
head
the
which
he
hearing
as
it
is
like
him
might
break
out
and
swear
hed
fetch
us
in
yet
ist
not
probable
to
come
alone
either
he
so
undertaking
or
they
so
suffering
then
on
good
ground
we
fear
if
we
do
fear
this

more
perilous

guiderius
why

the

belarius
let
us
from

arviragus
what
pleasure
sir
find
we
in
life
to
lock
it
from
action
and
adventure
guiderius
nay
what
hope
have
we
in
hiding
us
this
way
the
romans
must
or
for
britons
slay
us
or
receive
us
for
barbarous
and
unnatural
revolts
during
their
use
and
slay
us
after
belarius
sons
well
higher
to
the
mountains
there
secure
us
to
the

party
theres
no

newness
of

we
being

not

drive
us
to
a
render
where
we
have
livd
and
so
extort
froms
that
which
we
have
done
whose
answer
would
be
death
drawn
on
with
torture
guiderius
this
is
sir
a
doubt
in
such
a
time
nothing
becoming
you
nor
satisfying
us
arviragus
it
is
not
likely
that
when
they
hear
the
roman
horses
neigh
behold
their
quarterd
fires
have
both
their
eyes
and
ears
so
cloyd
importantly
as
now
that
they
will
waste
their
time
upon
our
note
to
know
from
whence
we
are
belarius
o
i
am
known
of
many
in
the
army
many
years
though
cloten
then
but
young
you
see
not
wore
him
from
my
remembrance
and
besides
the
king
hath
not
deservd
my
service
nor
your
loves
who
find
in
my
exile
the
want
of
breeding
the
certainty
of
this
hard
life
aye
hopeless
to
have
the
courtesy
your
cradle
promisd
but
to
be
still
hot
summers
tanlings
and
the
shrinking
slaves
of
winter
guiderius
than
be
so
better
to
cease
to
be
pray
sir
to
th
army
i
and
my
brother
are
not
known
yourself
so
out
of
thought
and
thereto
so
oergrown
cannot
be
questioned
arviragus
by
this
sun
that
shines
ill
thither
what
thing
ist
that
i
never
did
see
man
die
scarce
ever
lookd
on
blood
but
that
of
coward
hares
hot
goats
and
venison
never
bestrid
a
horse
save
one
that
had
a
rider
like
myself
who
neer
wore
rowel
nor
iron
on
his
heel
i
am
ashamd
to
look
upon
the
holy
sun
to
have
the
benefit
of
his
blest
beams
remaining
so
long
a
poor
unknown
guiderius
by
heavens
ill
go
if
you
will
bless
me
sir
and
give
me
leave
ill
take
the
better
care
but
if
you
will
not
the
hazard
therefore
due
fall
on
me
by
the
hands
of
romans
arviragus
so
say
i
amen
belarius
no
reason
i
since
of
your
lives
you
set
so
slight
a
valuation
should
reserve
my
crackd
one
to
more
care
have
with
you
boys
if
in
your
country
wars
you
chance
to
die
that

there
ill

a
good
repast
to
the
spectators
the
dish
pays
the
shot
gaoler
a
heavy
reckoning
for
you
sir
but
the
comfort
is
you
shall
be
called
to
no
more
payments
fear
no
more
tavern
bills
which
are
often
the
sadness
of
parting
as
the
procuring
of
mirth
you
come
in
faint
for
want
of
meat
depart
reeling
with
too
much
drink
sorry
that
you
have
paid
too
much
and
sorry
that
you
are
paid
too
much
purse
and
brain
both
empty
the
brain
the
heavier
for
being
too
light
the
purse
too
light
being
drawn
of
heaviness
o
of
this
contradiction
you
shall
now
be
quit
o
the
charity
of
a
penny
cord
it
sums
up
thousands
in
a
trice
you
have
no
true
debitor
and
creditor
but
it
of
whats
past
is
and
to
come
the
discharge
your
neck
sir
is
pen
book
and
counters
so
the
acquittance
follows
posthumus
i
am
merrier
to
die
than
thou
art
to
live
gaoler
indeed
sir
he
that
sleeps
feels
not
the
toothache
but
a
man
that
were
to
sleep
your
sleep
and
a
hangman
to
help
him
to
bed
i
think
he
would
change
places
with
his
officer
for
look
you
sir
you
know
not
which
way
you
shall
go
posthumus
yes
indeed
do
i
fellow
gaoler
your
death
has
eyes
ins

then
i
have
not
seen
him
so
picturd
you
must
either
be
directed
by
some
that
take
upon
them
to
know
or
to
take
upon
yourself
that
which
i
am
sure
you
do
not
know
or
jump
the
afterinquiry
on
your
own
peril
and
how
you
shall
speed
in
your
journeys
end
i
think
youll
never
return
to
tell
one
posthumus
i
tell
thee
fellow
there
are
none
want
eyes
to
direct
them
the
way
i
am
going
but
such
as
wink
and
will
not
use
them
gaoler
what
an
infinite
mock
is
this
that
a
man
should
have
the
best
use
of
eyes
to
see
the
way
of
blindness
i
am
sure
hangings
the
way
of
winking

enter

rarst
of

come
to
the
matter
iachimo
all
too
soon
i
shall
unless
thou
wouldst
grieve
quickly
this
posthumus
most
like
a
noble
lord
in

and
one
that
had
a
royal
lover
took
his
hint
and
not
dispraising
whom
we
praisd
therein
he
was
as
calm
as
virtue
he
began
his
mistress
picture
which
by
his
tongue
being
made

then
a
mind
put
int
either
our
brags
were
crackd

iachimo
your

chastity
there
it
begins
he
spake
of
her
as
dian
had
hot
dreams
and
she
alone
were
cold
whereat
i
wretch
made
scruple
of
his
praise
and
wagerd
with
him
pieces
of
gold
gainst
this
which
then
he
wore
upon
his
honourd
finger
to
attain
in
suit
the
place
ofs
bed
and
win
this
ring
by
hers
and
mine
adultery
he
true
knight
no
lesser
of
her
honour
confident
than
i
did
truly
find
her
stakes
this

would
so
had
it
been
a

of

and
might
so
safely
had
it
been
all
the
worth
ofs

in

design
well
may
you

remember
me
at

where
i
was

of
your

the
wide
difference
twixt
amorous

vilely
for

be
brief
my
practice
so
prevaild
that
i
returnd
with
simular
proof
enough
to
make
the

mad
by
wounding
his
belief
in

how
i

some

her
bond
of

quite
crackd
i
having

cornelius
cornelius
the
queen
sir
very
oft
importund
me
to
temper
poisons
for
her
still
pretending
the
satisfaction
of
her
knowledge
only
in
killing
creatures
vile
as
cats
and
dogs
of
no
esteem
i
dreading
that
her
purpose
was
of
more
danger
did
compound
for
her
a
certain
stuff
which
being
taen
would
cease
the
present
powr
of
life
but
in
short
time
all
offices
of
nature
should
again
do
their
due
functions
have
you
taen
of

imogen
most
like

did

was
dead
belarius

is
from

ill

troth
lord
cloten
upon
my
ladys
missing
came
to
me
with
his
sword
drawn
foamd
at
the
mouth
and
swore
if
i
discoverd
not
which
way
she
was
gone
it
was
my
instant
death
by
accident
i
had
a
feigned
letter
of
my
masters
then
in
my
pocket
which
directed
him
to
seek
her
on
the
mountains
near
to
milford
where
in
a
frenzy
in
my
masters
garments
which
he
enforcd
from
me
away
he
posts
with
unchaste
purpose
and
with
oath
to
violate
my
ladys
honour
what
became
of
him
i
further
know
not
guiderius
let
me
end
the
story
i
slew
him
there
cymbeline
marry
the
gods
forfend
i
would
not
thy
good
deeds
should
from
my
lips
pluck
a
hard
sentence
prithee
valiant
youth
denyt
again
guiderius
i
have
spoke
it
and
i
did
it
cymbeline
he
was
a
prince
guiderius
a
most
incivil
one
the
wrongs
he
did
me
were
nothing
princelike
for
he
did
provoke
me
with
language
that
would
make
me
spurn
the
sea
if
it
could
so
roar
to
me
i
cut
offs
head
and
am
right
glad
he
is
not
standing
here
to
tell
this
tale
of
mine
cymbeline
i
am
sorry
for
thee
by
thine
own
tongue
thou
art
condemnd
and
must
endure
our
law
thourt
dead
imogen
that
headless
man
i
thought
had
been
my
lord
cymbeline
bind
the
offender
and
take
him
from
our
presence
belarius
stay
sir
king
this
man
is
better
than
the
man
he
slew
as
well
descended
as
thyself
and
hath
more
of
thee
merited
than
a
band
of
clotens
had
ever
scar
for
to
the
guard
let
his
arms
alone
they
were
not
born
for
bondage
cymbeline
why
old
soldier
wilt
thou
undo
the
worth
thou
art
unpaid
for
by
tasting
of
our
wrath
how
of
descent
as
good
as
we
arviragus
in
that
he
spake
too
far
cymbeline
and
thou
shalt
die
fort
belarius
we
will
die
all
three
but
i
will
prove
that
two
ons
are
as
good
as
i
have
given
out
him
my
sons
i
must
for
mine
own
part
unfold
a
dangerous
speech
though
haply
well
for
you
arviragus
your
dangers
ours
guiderius
and
our
good
his
belarius
have
at
it
then
by
leave
thou
hadst
great
king
a
subject
who
was
calld
belarius
cymbeline
what
of
him
he
is
a
banishd
traitor
belarius
he
it
is
that
hath
assumd
this
age
indeed
a
banishd
man
i
know
not
how
a
traitor
cymbeline
take
him
hence
the
whole
world
shall
not
save
him
belarius
not
too
hot
first
pay
me
for
the
nursing
of
thy
sons
and
let
it
be
confiscate
all
so
soon
as
i
have
receivd
it
cymbeline
nursing
of
my
sons
belarius
i
am
too
blunt
and
saucy
heres
my
knee
ere
i
arise
i
will
prefer
my
sons
then
spare
not
the
old
father
mighty
sir
these
two
young
gentlemen
that
call
me
father
and
think
they
are
my
sons
are
none
of
mine
they
are
the
issue
of
your
loins
my
liege
and
blood
of
your
begetting
cymbeline
how
my
issue
belarius
so
sure
as
you
your
fathers
i
old
morgan
am
that
belarius
whom
you
sometime
banishd
your
pleasure
was
my
mere
offence
my
punishment
itself
and
all
my
treason
that
i
sufferd
was
all
the
harm
i
did
these
gentle
princes
for
such
and
so
they
are
these
twenty
years
have
i
traind
up
those
arts
they
have
as
could
put
into
them
my
breeding
was
sir
as
your
highness
knows
their
nurse
euriphile
whom
for
the
theft
i
wedded
stole
these
children
upon
my
banishment
i
movd
her
tot
having
receivd
the
punishment
before
for
that
which
i
did
then
beaten
for
loyalty
excited
me
to
treason
their
dear
loss
the
more
of
you
twas
felt
the
more
it
shapd
unto
my
end
of
stealing
them
but
gracious
sir
here
are
your
sons
again
and
i
must
lose
two
of
the
sweetst
companions
in
the
world
the
benediction
of
these
covering
heavens
fall
on
their
heads
like
dew
for
they
are
worthy
to
inlay
heaven
with
stars
cymbeline
thou
weepst
and
speakst
the
service
that
you
three
have
done
is
more
unlike
than
this
thou
tellst
i
lost
my
children
if
these
be
they
i
know
not
how
to
wish
a
pair
of
worthier
sons
belarius
be
pleasd
awhile
this
gentleman
whom
i
call
polydore
most
worthy
prince
as
yours
is
true
guiderius
this
gentleman
my
cadwal
arviragus
your
younger
princely
son
he
sir
was
lappd
in
a
most
curious
mantle
wrought
by
th
hand
of
his
queen
mother
which
for
more
probation
i
can
with
ease
produce
cymbeline
guiderius
had
upon
his
neck
a
mole
a
sanguine
star
it
was
a
mark
of
wonder
belarius
this
is
he
who
hath
upon
him
still
that
natural
stamp
it
was
wise
natures
end
in
the
donation
to

this
a
kingdom

good
lord

at
first
meeting
lovd
continud
so
until
we
thought
he
died
cornelius
by
the
queens
dram
she
swallowd
cymbeline
o
rare
instinct
when
shall
i
hear
all
through
this
fierce
abridgment
hath
to
it
circumstantial
branches
which
distinction
should
be
rich
in
where
how
livd
you
and
when
came
you
to
serve
our
roman
captive
how
parted
with
your
brothers
how
first
met
them
why
fled
you
from
the
court
and
whither
these
and
your
three
motives
to
the
battle
with
i
know
not
how
much
more
should
be
demanded
and
all
the
other
bydependences
from
chance
to
chance
but
nor
the
time
nor
place
will
serve
our
long
interrogatories
see
posthumus
anchors
upon
imogen
and
she
like
harmless
lightning
throws
her
eye
on
him
her
brothers
me
her
master
hitting
each
object
with
a
joy
the
counterchange
is
severally
in
all
lets
quit
this
ground
and
smoke
the
temple
with
our
sacrifices
to
belarius
thou
art
my
brother
so
well
hold
thee
ever
imogen
you
are
my
father
too
and
did
relieve
me
to
see
this
gracious
season
cymbeline
all
oerjoyd
save
these
in
bonds
let
them
be
joyful
too
for
they
shall
taste
our
comfort
imogen
my
good
master
i
will
yet
do
you
service
lucius
happy
be
you
cymbeline
the
forlorn
soldier
that
so
nobly
fought
he
would
have
well
becomd
this
place
and
gracd
the
thankings
of
a
king
posthumus
i
am
sir
the
soldier
that
did
company
these
three
in
poor
beseeming
twas
a
fitment
for
the
purpose
i
then
followd
that
i
was
he
speak
iachimo
i
had
you
down
and
might
have
made
you
finish
iachimo
kneeling
i
am
down
again
but
now
my
heavy
conscience
sinks
my
knee
as
then
your
force
did
take
that
life
beseech
you
which
i
so
often
owe
but
your
ring
first
and
here
the
bracelet
of
the
truest
princess
that
ever
swore
her
faith
posthumus
kneel
not
to
me
the
powr
that
i
have
on
you
is
to
spare
you
the
malice
towards
you
to
forgive
you
live
and
deal
with
others
better
cymbeline
nobly
doomd
well
learn
our
freeness
of
a
soninlaw
pardons
the
word
to
all
arviragus
you
holp
us
sir
as
you
did
mean
indeed
to
be
our

are
we
that
you
are
posthumus
your

good
my
lord
of

forth
your
soothsayer
as
i
slept
methought
great
jupiter
upon
his
eagle
backd
appeard
to
me
with
other
spritely
shows
of
mine
own
kindred
when
i
wakd
i
found
this
label
on
my
bosom
whose
containing
is
so
from
sense
in
hardness
that
i
can
make
no
collection
of
it
let
him
show
his
skill
in
the
construction
lucius
philarmonus
soothsayer
here
my
good
lord
lucius
read
and
declare
the
meaning
soothsayer
reads
when
as
a
lions
whelp
shall
to
himself
unknown
without
seeking
find
and
be
embracd
by
a
piece
of
tender
air
and
when
from
a
stately
cedar
shall
be
loppd
branches
which
being
dead
many
years
shall
after
revive
be
jointed
to
the
old
stock
and
freshly
grow
then
shall
posthumus
end
his
miseries
britain
be
fortunate
and
flourish
in
peace
and
plenty
thou
leonatus
art
the
lions
whelp
the
fit
and
apt
construction
of
thy
name
being
leonatus
doth
import
so
much
to
cymbeline
the
piece
of
tender
air
thy
virtuous
daughter
which
we
call
mollis
aer
and
mollis
aer
we
term
it
mulier
which
mulier
i
divine
is
this
most
constant
wife
who
even
now
answering
the
letter
of
the
oracle
unknown
to
you
unsought
were
clippd
about
with
this
most
tender
air
cymbeline
this
hath
some
seeming
soothsayer
the
lofty
cedar
royal
cymbeline
personates
thee
and
thy
loppd
branches
point
thy
two
sons
forth
who
by
belarius
stoln
for
many
years
thought
dead
are
now
revivd
to
the
majestic
cedar
joind
whose
issue
promises
britain
peace
and
plenty
cymbeline
well
my
peace
we
will
begin
and
caius
lucius
although
the
victor
we
submit
to
caesar
and
to
the
roman
empire
promising
to
pay
our
wonted
tribute
from
the
which
we
were
dissuaded
by
our
wicked
queen
whom
heavens
in
justice
both
on
her
and
hers
have
laid
most
heavy
hand
soothsayer
the
fingers
of
the
powrs
above
do
tune
the
harmony
of
this
peace
the
vision
which
i
made
known
to
lucius
ere
the
stroke
of
yet
this
scarcecold
battle
at
this
instant
is
full
accomplishd
for
the
roman
eagle
from
south
to
west
on
wing
soaring
aloft
lessend
herself
and
in
the
beams
o
th
sun
so
vanishd
which
foreshowd
our
princely
eagle
thimperial
caesar
caesar
should
again
unite
his
favour
with
the
radiant
cymbeline
which
shines
here
in
the
west
cymbeline
laud
we
the
gods
and
let
our
crooked
smokes
climb
to
their
nostrils
from
our
blessd
altars
publish
we
this
peace
to
all
our
subjects
set
we
forward
let
a
roman
and
a
british
ensign
wave
friendly
together
so
through
luds
town
march
and
in
the
temple
of
great
jupiter
our
peace
well
ratify
seal
it
with
feasts
set
on
there
never
was
a
war
did
cease
ere
bloody

were
washd
with

in

and
scope
of

opinion

bodes
some
strange
eruption
to
our
state
mar
good
now
sit
down
and
tell
me
he
that
knows
why
this

strict
and
most
observant
watch
so
nightly
toils
the
subject
of
the
land
and
why
such
daily
cast
of
brazen
cannon
and
foreign
mart
for
implements
of
war
why
such
impress
of
shipwrights
whose
sore
task
does
not
divide
the
sunday
from

week
what
might
be

this
sweaty
haste
doth
make

night
jointlabourer
with
the
day
who
ist
that
can
inform
me
hor
that
can
i
at
least
the
whisper
goes
so
our
last
king
whose
image
even
but
now
appeard
to
us
was
as
you
know
by
fortinbras
of
norway
thereto
prickd
on
by
a
most
emulate
pride
dard
to
the
combat
in
which
our
valiant
hamlet
for
so
this
side
of
our
known
world
esteemd
him
did
slay
this
fortinbras
who
by
a
seald
compact
well
ratified
by
law
and
heraldry
did
forfeit
with
his
life
all
those
his
lands
which
he
stood
seizd
of
to
the
conqueror
against
the
which
a
moiety
competent
was
gaged
by
our
king
which
had
returnd
to
the
inheritance
of
fortinbras
had
he
been
vanquisher
as
by
the
same
comart
and
carriage
of
the
article
designd
his
fell
to
hamlet
now
sir
young
fortinbras
of
unimproved
mettle
hot
and
full
hath
in
the
skirts
of
norway
here
and
there
sharkd
up
a
list
of
lawless
resolutes
for
food
and
diet
to
some
enterprise
that
hath
a
stomach
int
which
is
no
other
as
it
doth
well
appear
unto
our
state
but
to
recover
of
us
by
strong
hand
and
terms
compulsatory
those
foresaid
lands
so
by
his
father
lost
and
this
i
take
it
is
the
main
motive
of
our
preparations
the
source
of
this
our
watch
and
the
chief
head
of
this
posthaste
and
romage
in
the
land
ber
i
think
it
be
no
other
but
een
so
well
may
it
sort
that
this
portentous
figure
comes
armed
through
our
watch
so
like
the
king
that
was
and
is
the
question
of
these
wars
hor
a
mote
it
is
to
trouble
the
minds

in
the
most
high
and
palmy
state
of
rome
a
little
ere
the
mightiest
julius
fell
the
graves
stood
tenantless
and
the
sheeted
dead
did
squeak
and
gibber
in
the
roman
streets
as
stars
with
trains
of
fire
and
dews
of
blood
disasters
in
the
sun
and
the
moist
star
upon
whose
influence
neptunes

sick
almost
to
doomsday
with
eclipse

even
the
like
precurse

with

awake

our

in
grief

our
whole

so

importing
the
surrender
of
those
lands
lost

impotent

bedrid
scarcely
hears
of
this
his

purpose
to
suppress
his

dispatch

my
offer
not
thy
asking
the
head
is
not
more
native
to
the
heart
the
hand
more
instrumental
to
the
mouth
than
is
the
throne
of

to
thy

what
wouldst
thou
have
laertes
laer
my
dread
lord
your
leave
and
favour

willingly
i
came

to
show
my
duty
in
your
coronation
yet
now
i
must
confess
that
duty
done
my
thoughts
and
wishes
bend
again
toward
france
and
bow
them
to
your
gracious
leave
and
pardon
king
have
you
your
fathers
leave
what
says
polonius
pol
he
hath
my
lord
wrung
from
me
my
slow
leave
by
laboursome
petition
and
at
last
upon
his
will
i
seald
my
hard
consent
i
do
beseech
you
give
him
leave
to
go
king
take
thy
fair
hour
laertes
time
be
thine
and
thy
best
graces
spend
it
at
thy
will
but
now
my
cousin
hamlet
and
my
son
ham
aside
a
little
more
than
kin
and
less
than
kind
king
how
is
it
that
the
clouds
still
hang
on
you
ham
not
so
my
lord
i
am
too
much
i
th
sun
queen
good
hamlet
cast
thy
nighted
colour
off
and
let
thine
eye
look
like
a
friend
on
denmark
do
not
for
ever
with
thy
vailed
lids
seek
for
thy
noble
father
in
the
dust
thou
knowst
tis
common
all
that
lives
must
die
passing
through
nature
to
eternity
ham
ay
madam
it
is
common
queen
if
it
be
why
seems
it
so
particular
with
thee
ham
seems
madam
nay
it
is
i
know
not
seems
tis
not
alone
my
inky
cloak
good
mother
nor
customary
suits
of
solemn
black
nor
windy
suspiration
of
forcd
breath
no
nor
the
fruitful
river
in
the
eye
nor
the
dejected
havior
of
the
visage
together
with
all
forms
moods
shapes
of
grief
that
can
denote
me
truly
these
indeed
seem
for
they
are
actions
that
a
man
might
play
but
i
have
that
within
which
passeth
show
these
but
the
trappings
and
the
suits
of
woe
king
tis
sweet
and
commendable
in
your
nature
hamlet
to
give
these
mourning
duties
to
your
father
but
you
must
know
your
father
lost
a
father
that
father
lost
lost
his
and
the
survivor
bound
in
filial
obligation
for
some
term
to
do
obsequious
sorrow
but
to
persever
in
obstinate
condolement
is
a
course
of
impious
stubbornness
tis
unmanly
grief
it
shows
a
will
most
incorrect
to
heaven
a
heart
unfortified
a
mind
impatient
an
understanding
simple
and
unschoold
for
what
we
know
must
be
and
is
as
common
as
any
the
most
vulgar
thing
to
sense
why
should
we
in
our
peevish
opposition
take
it
to
heart
fie
tis
a
fault
to
heaven
a
fault
against
the
dead
a
fault
to
nature
to
reason
most
absurd
whose
common
theme
is
death
of
fathers
and
who
still
hath
cried
from
the
first
corse
till
he
that
died
today
this
must
be
so
we
pray
you
throw
to
earth
this
unprevailing
woe
and
think
of
us
as
of
a
father
for
let
the
world
take
note
you
are
the
most
immediate
to
our
throne
and
with
no
less
nobility
of
love
than
that
which
dearest
father
bears
his
son
do
i
impart
toward
you
for
your
intent
in
going
back
to
school
in
wittenberg
it
is
most
retrograde
to
our
desire
and
we
beseech
you
bend
you
to
remain
here
in
the
cheer
and
comfort
of
our
eye
our
chiefest
courtier
cousin
and
our
son
queen
let
not
thy
mother
lose
her
prayers
hamlet
i
pray
thee
stay
with
us
go
not
to
wittenberg
ham
i
shall
in
all
my
best
obey
you
madam
king
why
tis
a
loving
and
a
fair
reply
be
as
ourself
in
denmark
madam
come
this
gentle
and
unforcd
accord
of
hamlet
sits
smiling
to
my
heart
in
grace
whereof
no
jocund
health
that
denmark
drinks
today
but
the
great
cannon
to
the
clouds
shall
tell
and
the
kings
rouse
the

so
excellent
a
king
that
was

roughly

she
even

o

a

stately
by

by
their
oppressd

fearsurprised
eyes
within

act
of
fear

in
dreadful
secrecy

even
then
the
morning
cock
crew
loud
and
at
the
sound
it
shrunk
in

vanishd
from

very
strange

as

laer
my
necessaries

embarkd
farewell
and
sister
as
the
winds
give
benefit

do
not
sleep
but
let
me
hear
from
you
oph
do
you
doubt
that
laer
for
hamlet
and
the
trifling
of
his
favour
hold
it
a
fashion
and
a
toy
in
blood
a
violet
in
the
youth
of
primy
nature
forward
not
permanent
sweet
not
lasting
the
perfume
and
suppliance
of
a
minute
no
more
oph
no
more
but
so
laer
think
it
no
more
for
nature
crescent
does
not
grow
alone
in
thews
and
bulk
but
as
this
temple
waxes
the
inward
service
of
the
mind
and
soul
grows
wide
withal
perhaps
he
loves
you
now
and
now
no
soil
nor
cautel
doth
besmirch
the
virtue
of
his
will
but
you
must
fear
his
greatness
weighd
his
will
is
not
his
own
for
he
himself
is
subject
to
his
birth
he
may
not
as
unvalued
persons
do
carve
for
himself
for
on
his
choice
depends
the
safety
and
health
of
this
whole
state
and
therefore
must
his
choice
be
circumscribd
unto
the
voice
and
yielding
of
that
body
whereof
he
is
the
head
then
if
he
says
he
loves
you
it
fits
your
wisdom
so
far
to
believe
it
as
he
in
his
particular
act
and
place
may
give
his
saying
deed
which
is
no
further
than
the
main
voice
of
denmark
goes
withal
then
weigh
what
loss
your
honour
may
sustain
if
with
too
credent
ear
you
list
his
songs
or
lose
your
heart
or
your
chaste
treasure
open
to
his
unmastred
importunity
fear
it
ophelia
fear
it
my
dear
sister
and
keep
you
in
the
rear
of
your
affection
out
of
the
shot
and
danger
of
desire
the
chariest
maid
is
prodigal
enough
if
she
unmask
her
beauty
to
the
moon
virtue
itself
scopes
not
calumnious
strokes
the
canker
galls
the
infants
of
the
spring
too
oft
before
their
buttons
be
disclosd
and
in
the
morn
and
liquid
dew
of

contagious
blastments
are
most
imminent

lies

to

though
i

more

tale

lightest
word

harrow
up
thy

thy

eyes

stars
start
from
their
spheres
thy
knotted
and
combined
locks
to
part
and
each
particular
hair
to
stand
an
end
like
quills
upon
the
fretful
porpentine

blazon

of

thy

i
with

as
swift
as
meditation

the
thoughts
of

may
sweep
to
my
revenge

find
thee
apt

thou

the
fat
weed
that
rots
itself
in

on
lethe

thou
not
stir
in
this
now
hamlet

tis
given
out
that
sleeping
in
my
orchard
a
serpent
stung
me
so
the
whole
ear
of
denmark
is
by
a
forged
process
of
my
death
rankly
abusd
but
know
thou
noble
youth
the
serpent
that
did
sting
thy
fathers
life
now
wears
his
crown
ham
o
my
prophetic
soul
my
uncle
ghost
ay
that
incestuous
that
adulterate
beast
with
witchcraft
of
his
wit
with
traitorous
gifts
o
wicked
wit
and
gifts
that
have
the
power
so
to
seduce
won
to
his
shameful
lust
the
will
of
my
most
seemingvirtuous
queen
o
hamlet
what
a
fallingoff
was
there
from
me
whose
love
was
of
that
dignity
that
it
went
hand
in
hand
even
with
the
vow
i
made
to
her
in
marriage
and
to
decline
upon
a
wretch
whose
natural
gifts
were
poor
to
those
of
mine
but
virtue
as
it
never
will
be
movd
though
lewdness
court
it
in
a
shape
of
heaven
so
lust
though
to
a
radiant
angel
linkd
will
sate
itself
in
a
celestial
bed
and
prey
on
garbage
but
soft
methinks
i
scent
the
morning
air
brief
let
me
be
sleeping
within
my
orchard
my
custom
always
of
the
afternoon
upon
my
secure
hour
thy
uncle
stole
with
juice
of
cursed
hebona
in
a
vial
and
in
the
porches
of
my
ears
did
pour
the
leperous
distilment
whose
effect
holds
such
an
enmity
with
blood
of
man
that
swift
as
quicksilverr
it
courses
through
the
natural
gates
and
alleys
of
the
body
and
with
a
sudden
vigour
it
doth
posset
and
curd
like
eager
droppings
into
milk
the
thin
and
wholesome
blood
so
did
it
mine
and
a
most
instant
tetter
barkd
about
most
lazarlike
with
vile
and
loathsome
crust
all
my
smooth
body
thus
was
i
sleeping
by
a
brothers
hand
of
life
of
crown
of
queen
at
once
dispatchd
cut
off
even
in
the
blossoms
of
my
sin
unhousled
disappointed
unaneld
no

made
but
sent
to
my
account
with
all
my
imperfections
on

reynaldo
rey
i
will
my
lord
pol
you
shall
do
marvells
wisely
good
reynaldo
before
you
visit
him
to
make
inquire
of
his
behaviour
rey
my
lord
i
did
intend
it
pol
marry
well
said
very
well
said
look
you
sir
enquire
me
first
what
danskers
are
in
paris
and
how
and
who
what
means
and
where
they
keep
what
company
at
what
expense
and
finding
by
this
encompassment
and
drift
of
question
that
they
do
know
my
son
come
you
more
nearer
than
your
particular
demands
will
touch
it
take
you
as
twere
some
distant
knowledge
of
him
as
thus
i
know
his
father
and
his
friends
and
in
part
him
do
you
mark
this
reynaldo
rey
ay
very
well
my
lord
pol
and
in
part
him
but
you
may
say
not
well
but
ift
be
he
i
mean
hes
very
wild
addicted
so
and
so
and
there
put
on
him
what
forgeries
you
please
marry
none
so
rank
as
may
dishonour
him
take
heed
of
that
but
sir
such
wanton
wild
and
usual
slips
as
are
companions
noted
and
most
known
to
youth
and
liberty
rey
as
gaming
my
lord
pol
ay
or
drinking
fencing
swearing
quarrelling
drabbing
you
may
go
so
far
rey
my
lord
that
would
dishonour
him
pol
faith
no
as
you
may
season
it
in
the
charge
you
must
not
put
another
scandal
on
him
that
he
is
open
to
incontinency
thats
not
my
meaning
but
breathe
his
faults
so
quaintly
that
they
may
seem
the
taints
of
liberty
the
flash
and
outbreak
of
a
fiery
mind
a
savageness
in
unreclaimed
blood
of
general
assault
rey
but
my
good
lord
pol
wherefore
should
you
do
this
rey
ay
my
lord
i
would
know
that
pol
marry

i
believe
it

a
fetch

slight
sullies

little
soild

prenominate
crimes

youth

breathe
of
guilty
be
assurd
he
closes
with
you
in
this
consequence
good
sir
or
so
or
friend
or
gentleman
according
to
the
phrase
or
the
addition
of
man
and
country
rey
very
good
my
lord
pol
and
then
sir
does
a
this
a
does
what
was
i
about
to

the
mass
i
was
about
to
say
something
where

leave

in
the
consequence
at

the
gentleman

and
as
you
say
there
was
a
gaming

or
perchance

saw
him
enter
such
a
house
of
sale
videlicet
a
brothel
or
so
forth
see
you
now
your
bait
of
falsehood
takes
this
carp
of
truth
and
thus
do
we
of
wisdom
and
of
reach

windlasses
and
with
assays
of

find

how
now
ophelia
whats
the
matter
oph
o
my
lord
my
lord
i
have
been
so
affrighted
pol
with
what
i
th
name
of
god
i
oph
my
lord
as
i
was
sewing
in
my
closet
lord
hamlet
with
his
doublet
all
unbracd
no
hat
upon
his
head
his
stockings
fould
ungartred
and
downgyved
to
his
ankle
pale
as
his
shirt
his
knees
knocking
each
other
and
with
a
look
so
piteous
in
purport
as
if
he
had
been
loosed
out
of
hell
to
speak
of
horrors
he
comes
before
me
pol
mad
for
thy
love
oph
my
lord
i
do
not
know
but
truly
i
do
fear
it
pol
what
said
he
oph
he
took
me
by
the
wrist
and
held
me
hard
then
goes
he
to
the
length
of
all
his
arm
and
with
his
other
hand
thus
oer
his
brow
he
falls
to
such
perusal
of
my
face
as
he
would
draw
it
long
stayd
he
so
at
last
a
little
shaking
of
mine
arm
and
thrice
his
head
thus
waving
up
and
down
he
raisd
a
sigh
so
piteous
and
profound
as
it
did
seem
to
shatter
all
his
bulk
and
end
his
being
that
done
he
lets
me
go
and
with
his
head
over
his
shoulder
turnd
he
seemd
to
find
his
way
without
his
eyes
for
out
o
doors
he
went
without
their
help
and
to
the
last
bended
their
light
on
me
pol
come
go
with
me
i
will
go
seek
the
king
this
is
the
very
ecstasy
of
love
whose
violent
property
fordoes
itself
and
leads
the
will
to
desperate
undertakings
as
oft
as
any
passion
under
heaven
that
does
afflict
our
natures
i
am
sorry
what
have
you
given
him
any
hard
words
of
late
oph
no
my
good
lord
but
as
you
did
command
i
did
repel
his
letters
and
denied
his
access
to
me
pol
that
hath
made
him
mad
i
am
sorry
that
with
better
heed
and
judgment
i
had
not
quoted
him
i
feard
he
did
but
trifle
and
meant
to
wrack
thee
but
beshrew
my
jealousy
by
heaven
it
is
as
proper
to
our
age
to
cast
beyond
ourselves
in
our
opinions
as
it
is
common
for
the
younger
sort
to
lack
discretion
come
go
we
to
the
king
this
must
be
known
which
being
kept
close
might
move
more
grief
to
hide
than
hate
to
utter
love

from

entreat

so
young

you
vouchsafe
your
rest

some
little
time
so
by

to
draw

on
to
pleasures

to
gather
so
much

may
glean
whether
aught
to

afflicts

above
hath
his
solicitings
as
they
fell
out
by
time
by
means
and
place
all
given
to
mine

but
how
hath
she
receivd
his
love
pol
what
do
you
think
of
me
king
as
of
a
man
faithful
and
honourable
pol
i
would
fain
prove
so
but
what
might
you
think
when
i
had
seen
this
hot
love
on
the
wing
as
i
perceivd
it
i
must
tell
you
that
before
my
daughter
told
me
what
might
you
or
my
dear
majesty
your
queen
here
think
if
i
had
playd
the
desk
or
table
book
or
given
my
heart
a
winking
mute
and
dumb
or
lookd
upon
this
love
with
idle
sight
what
might
you
think
no
i
went
round
to
work
and
my
young
mistress
thus
i
did
bespeak
lord
hamlet
is
a
prince
out
of
thy
star
this
must
not
be
and
then
i
prescripts
gave
her
that
she
should
lock
herself
from
his
resort
admit
no
messengers
receive
no
tokens
which
done
she
took
the
fruits
of
my
advice
and
he
repulsed
a
short
tale
to
make
fell
into
a
sadness
then
into
a
fast
thence
to
a
watch
thence
into
a
weakness
thence
to
a
lightness
and
by
this
declension
into
the
madness
wherein
now
he
raves
and
all
we
mourn
for
king
do
you
think
tis
this
queen
it
may
be
very
like
pol
hath
there
been
such
a
time

would
fain
know
that
that

me
i
will
find
where
truth
is
hid
though

were
hid
indeed
within
the
centre

how
may
we
try
it
further
pol
you

four
hours
together

count
myself
a
king
of
infinite
space
were
it
not
that
i
have
bad
dreams
guil
which
dreams
indeed
are
ambition
for
the
very
substance
of
the
ambitious

merely
the
shadow

a

to

purpose
you

there
is
a
kind
of
confession
in
your
looks

your
modesties

not

the
good
king

that
you
must
teach

conjure
you
by
the
rights
of

fellowship
by
the
consonancy
of

not
off

my
lord
we
were
sent

i
will
tell
you
why
so
shall
my
anticipation
prevent
your
discovery
and
your
secrecy
to
the
king

moult
no
feather
i
have
of
late
but
wherefore
i
know
not
lost
all
my
mirth
forgone
all
custom
of
exercises
and
indeed
it
goes
so
heavily
with
my
disposition
that
this
goodly
frame
the
earth
seems
to
me
a
sterile
promontory
this
most
excellent
canopy
the
air
look
you
this
brave
oerhanging
firmament
this
majestical
roof
fretted
with
golden
fire
why
it
appeareth
no
other
thing
to
me
than
a
foul
and
pestilent
congregation
of
vapours
what
a
piece
of
work
is
a
man
how
noble
in
reason
how
infinite
in
faculties
in
form
and
moving
how
express
and
admirable
in
action
how
like
an
angel
in
apprehension
how
like
a
god
the
beauty
of
the
world
the
paragon
of
animals
and
yet
to
me
what
is
this
quintessence
of
dust
man
delights
not
me
no
nor
woman
neither
though
by
your
smiling
you
seem
to
say
so
ros
my
lord
there
was
no
such
stuff
in
my
thoughts
ham
why
did
you
laugh
then
when
i
said
man
delights
not
me
ros
to
think
my
lord
if
you
delight
not
in
man
what
lenten
entertainment
the
players
shall
receive
from
you
we
coted
them
on
the
way
and
hither
are
they
coming
to
offer
you
service
ham
he
that
plays
the
king
shall
be
welcome
his
majesty
shall
have
tribute
of
me
the
adventurous
knight
shall
use
his
foil
and
target
the
lover
shall
not
sigh
gratis
the
humorous
man
shall
end
his
part
in
peace
the
clown
shall
make
those
laugh
whose
lungs
are

o
th
sere
and
the
lady
shall
say
her
mind
freely
or
the
blank
verse
shall
halt
fort
what
players
are
they
ros
even
those
you
were
wont
to
take
such
delight
in
the
tragedians
of
the
city
ham
how
chances
it
they
travel
their
residence
both
in
reputation
and
profit
was
better
both
ways
ros
i
think
their
inhibition
comes
by
the
means
of
the
late
innovation
ham
do
they
hold
the
same
estimation
they
did
when
i
was
in
the
city
are
they
so
followd
ros
no
indeed
are
they
not
ham
how
comes
it
do
they
grow
rusty
ros
nay
their
endeavour
keeps
in
the
wonted
pace
but
there
is
sir
an
eyrie
of
children
little
eyases
that
cry
out
on
the
top
of
question
and
are
most
tyrannically
clappd
fort
these
are
now
the
fashion
and
so
berattle
the
common
stages
so
they
call

what
speech
my
good

ham
i
heard
thee
speak
me
a
speech
once
but
it
was
never
acted

if
it
was
not
above
once
for
the

i
remember
pleasd
not
the
million
twas
caviary
to
the
general
but
it
was
as
i
receivd
it
and
others
whose
judgments
in
such
matters
cried
in
the
top
of
mine
an
excellent
play
well
digested
in
the
scenes
set
down
with
as
much
modesty
as
cunning
i
remember
one
said
there
were
no
sallets
in
the
lines
to
make
the
matter
savoury
nor
no
matter
in
the
phrase
that
might
indict
the
author
of
affectation
but
calld
it
an
honest
method
as
wholesome
as
sweet
and
by
very
much
more
handsome
than
fine

speech

roasted

thus
oersized

guilty

sitting
at

by
the
very
cunning
of
the
scene
been
struck
so
to
the
soul
that
presently
they

proclaimd
their
malefactions
for
murther
though
it

no
tongue

my
melancholy

rosencrantz
guildenstern
and
lords

king
and
can
you
by
no
drift
of
circumstance
get
from
him
why
he
puts
on
this
confusion
grating
so
harshly
all
his
days
of
quiet
with
turbulent
and
dangerous
lunacy
ros
he
does
confess
he
feels
himself
distracted
but
from
what
cause
he
will
by
no
means
speak
guil
nor
do
we
find
him
forward
to
be
sounded
but
with
a
crafty
madness
keeps
aloof
when
we
would
bring
him
on
to
some
confession
of
his
true
state
queen
did
he
receive
you
well
ros
most
like
a
gentleman
guil
but
with
much
forcing
of
his
disposition
ros
niggard
of
question
but
of
our
demands
most
free
in
his
reply
queen
did
you
assay
him
to
any
pastime
ros
madam
it
so
fell
out
that
certain
players
we
oerraught
on
the
way
of
these
we
told
him
and
there
did
seem
in
him
a
kind
of
joy
to
hear
of
it
they
are
here
about
the
court
and
as
i
think
they
have
already
order
this
night
to
play
before
him
pol
tis
most
true
and
he
beseechd
me
to
entreat
your
majesties
to
hear
and
see
the
matter
king
with
all
my
heart
and
it
doth
much
content
me
to
hear
him
so
inclind
good
gentlemen
give
him
a
further
edge
and
drive
his
purpose
on
to
these
delights
ros
we
shall
my
lord
exeunt
rosencrantz
and
guildenstern

sweet
gertrude

here
affront
ophelia
her
father
and
myself
lawful
espials
will
so
bestow
ourselves
that
seeing
unseen
we
may
of
their
encounter
frankly
judge
and
gather
by
him
as
he
is
behavd
ift
be
th
affliction
of
his
love

thus
he
suffers
for

mind
to
suffer
the
slings
and
arrows
of
outrageous
fortune
or
to
take
arms
against
a
sea
of
troubles
and
by
opposing
end
them
to
die
to
sleep
no
more
and
by
a
sleep
to
say
we
end
the
heartache
and
the
thousand
natural
shocks
that
flesh
is
heir
to
tis
a
consummation
devoutly
to
be
wishd
to
die
to
sleep
to
sleep
perchance
to
dream
ay
theres
the
rub
for
in
that
sleep
of
death
what
dreams
may
come
when
we
have
shuffled
off
this
mortal
coil
must
give
us
pause
theres
the
respect
that
makes
calamity
of
so
long
life
for
who
would
bear
the
whips
and
scorns
of
time
th
oppressors
wrong
the
proud
mans
contumely
the
pangs
of
despisd
love
the
laws
delay
the
insolence
of
office
and
the
spurns
that
patient
merit
of
th
unworthy
takes
when
he
himself
might
his
quietus
make
with
a
bare
bodkin
who
would
these
fardels
bear
to
grunt
and
sweat
under
a
weary
life
but
that
the
dread
of
something
after
death
the
undiscoverd
country
from
whose
bourn
no
traveller
returns
puzzles
the
will
and
makes
us
rather
bear
those
ills
we
have
than
fly
to
others
that
we
know
not
of
thus
conscience
does
make
cowards
of
us
all
and
thus
the
native
hue
of
resolution
is
sicklied
oer
with
the
pale
cast
of
thought
and
enterprises
of
great
pith
and
moment
with
this
regard
their
currents
turn
awry
and
lose
the
name
of
action
soft

my

have
better
commerce

honesty
ham
ay
truly
for
the
power
of
beauty
will
sooner
transform
honesty
from
what
it
is
to
a
bawd
than
the
force
of
honesty

translate

scene
ii
elsinore
hall
in
the
castle

enter
hamlet
and
three
of
the
players

ham
speak
the
speech
i
pray
you
as
i
pronouncd
it
to
you
trippingly
on
the
tongue
but
if
you
mouth
it
as
many
of
our
players
do
i
had
as
live
the
town
crier
spoke
my
lines
nor
do
not
saw
the
air
too
much
with
your
hand
thus
but
use
all
gently
for
in
the
very
torrent
tempest
and
as
i
may
say
whirlwind
of
your
passion
you
must
acquire
and
beget
a
temperance
that
may
give
it
smoothness
o
it
offends
me
to
the
soul
to
hear
a
robustious
periwigpated
fellow
tear
a
passion
to
tatters
to
very
rags
to
split
the
cars
of
the
groundlings
who
for
the
most
part
are
capable
of
nothing
but
inexplicable
dumb
shows
and
noise
i
would
have
such
a
fellow
whippd
for
oerdoing
termagant
it
outherods
herod
pray
you
avoid
it
player
i
warrant
your
honour
ham
be
not
too
tame
neither
but
let
your
own
discretion
be
your
tutor
suit
the
action
to
the
word
the
word
to
the
action
with
this
special
observance
that
you
oerstep
not
the
modesty
of
nature
for
anything
so
overdone
is
from
the
purpose
of
playing
whose
end
both
at
the
first
and
now
was
and
is
to
hold
as
twere
the
mirror
up
to
nature
to
show
virtue
her
own
feature
scorn
her
own
image
and
the
very
age
and
body
of
the
time
his
form
and
pressure
now
this
overdone
or
come
tardy
off
though
it
make
the
unskilful
laugh
cannot
but
make
the
judicious
grieve
the
censure
of
the
which
one
must
in
your
allowance
oerweigh
a
whole
theatre
of
others
o
there
be
players
that
i
have
seen
play
and
heard
others
praise
and
that
highly
not
to
speak
it
profanely
that
neither
having
the
accent
of
christians
nor
the
gait
of
christian
pagan
nor
man
have
so
strutted
and
bellowed
that
i
have
thought
some
of
natures
journeymen
had
made
men
and
not
made
them
well
they
imitated
humanity
so
abominably
player
i
hope
we
have
reformd
that
indifferently
with
us
sir
ham
o
reform
it
altogether
and
let
those
that
play
your
clowns
speak
no
more
than
is
set
down
for
them
for
there
be
of
them
that
will
themselves
laugh
to
set
on
some
quantity
of
barren
spectators
to
laugh
too
though
in
the
mean
time
some
necessary
question
of
the
play
be
then
to
be
considered
thats
villanous
and
shows
a
most
pitiful
ambition

i

that

false

here
upon

picture

on
this
the
counterfeit
presentment
of
two
brothers
see
what
a
grace
was
seated
on
this
brow
hyperions
curls
the
front
of
jove
himself
an
eye
like
mars
to
threaten
and
command
a
station
like
the
herald
mercury
new
lighted
on
a
heavenkissing
hill
a
combination
and
a
form
indeed
where
every
god
did
seem
to
set
his
seal
to
give
the
world
assurance
of
a
man
this
was
your
husband
look

what
follows
here

moor

have
you

you
cannot
call
it
love
for
at
your
age
the
heyday
in
the
blood
is
tame
its
humble
and
waits
upon
the
judgment
and
what
judgment
would
step
from
this
to
this
sense
sure
you
have
else
could
you
not
have
motion
but
sure
that
sense
is
apoplexd
for
madness
would
not
err
nor
sense
to
ecstacy
was
neer
so
thralld
but
it
reservd
some
quantity
of
choice
to
serve
in
such
a
difference
what

cozend
you

mope
o
shame
where
is
thy
blush
rebellious
hell
if
thou
canst
mutine
in

youth
let
virtue
be
as
wax

melt
in
her

fire

compulsive
ardour

vice

very
cunning
in

ecstasy
my
pulse
as
yours

temperately
keep

healthful
music
it
is
not
madness
that
i
have
uttred
bring
me
to
the
test
and
i
the
matter
will
reword
which
madness
would
gambol
from

flattering
unction
to

forgive
me
this
my
virtue
for
in
the
fatness
of
these
pursy
times
virtue
itself
of
vice
must
pardon
beg
yea
curb
and
woo
for
leave
to
do
him
good
queen
o
hamlet
thou
hast
cleft
my
heart
in
twain
ham
o
throw
away
the
worser
part
of
it
and
live
the
purer
with
the
other
half
good
night
but
go
not
to
my
uncles
bed
assume
a
virtue
if
you
have
it
not
that
monster
custom
who
all
sense
doth
eat
of
habits
evil
is
angel
yet
in
this
that
to
the
use
of
actions
fair
and
good
he
likewise
gives
a
frock
or
livery
that
aptly
is
put
on
refrain
tonight
and
that
shall
lend
a
kind
of
easiness
to
the
next
abstinence
the
next
more
easy
for
use
almost
can
change
the
stamp
of
nature
and
either
master
the
devil
or
throw
him
out
with
wondrous
potency
once
more
good
night
and
when
you
are
desirous
to
be
blest
ill
blessing
beg
of
you
for
this
same
lord
i
do
repent
but
heaven
hath
pleasd
it
so
to
punish
me
with
this
and
this
with
me
that
i
must
be
their
scourge
and
minister
i
will
bestow
him
and
will
answer
well
the
death
i
gave
him
so
again
good
night
i
must
be
cruel
only
to
be
kind

worse

elsinore
another
room
in
the
castle

enter
king
and
laertes

king
now
must
your
conscience
my
acquittance
seal
and
you
must
put
me
in
your
heart
for
friend
sith
you
have
heard
and
with
a
knowing
ear
that
he
which
hath
your
noble
father
slain
pursued
my
life
laer
it
well
appears
but
tell
me
why
you
proceeded
not
against
these
feats
so
crimeful
and
so
capital
in
nature
as
by
your
safety
wisdom
all
things
else
you
mainly
were
stirrd
up
king
o
for
two
special
reasons
which
may
to
you
perhaps
seein
much
unsinewd
but
yet
to
me
they
are
strong
the
queen
his
mother
lives
almost
by
his
looks
and
for
myself
my
virtue
or
my
plague
be
it
either
which
shes
so
conjunctive
to
my
life
and
soul
that
as
the
star
moves
not
but
in
his
sphere
i
could
not
but
by
her
the
other
motive
why
to
a
public
count
i
might
not
go
is
the
great
love
the
general
gender
bear
him
who
dipping
all
his
faults
in
their
affection
would
like
the
spring
that
turneth
wood
to
stone
convert
his
gives
to
graces
so
that
my
arrows
too
slightly
timberd
for
so
loud
a
wind
would
have
reverted
to
my
bow
again
and
not
where
i
had
aimd
them
laer
and
so
have
i
a
noble
father
lost
a
sister
driven
into
desprate
terms
whose
worth
if
praises
may
go
back
again
stood
challenger
on
mount
of
all
the
age
for
her
perfections
but
my
revenge
will
come
king
break
not
your
sleeps
for
that
you
must
not
think
that
we
are
made
of
stuff
so
flat
and
dull
that
we
can
let
our
beard
be
shook
with
danger
and
think
it
pastime
you
shortly
shall
hear
more
i
lovd
your
father
and
we
love
ourself
and
that
i
hope
will
teach
you
to
imagine

no
such

in
a
postscript
here
he
says
alone
can
you
advise
me
laer
i
am
lost
in
it
my
lord
but
let
him
come
it
warms
the
very
sickness
in
my
heart
that
i
shall
live
and
tell
him
to
his
teeth
thus
didest
thou
king
if
it
be
so
laertes
as
how
should
it
be
so
how
otherwise
will
you
be
ruld
by
me
laer
ay
my
lord
so
you
will
not
oerrule
me
to
a
peace
king
to
thine
own
peace
if
he
be
now
returnd
as
checking
at
his
voyage
and
that
he
means
no
more
to
undertake
it
i
will
work
him
to
exploit
now
ripe
in
my
device
under
the
which
he
shall
not
choose
but
fall
and
for
his
death
no
wind
but
even
his
mother
shall
uncharge
the
practice
and
call
it
accident
laer
my
lord
i
will
be
ruld
the
rather
if
you
could
devise
it
so
that
i
might
be
the
organ
king
it
falls
right
you
have
been
talkd
of
since
your
travel
much
and
that
in
hamlets
hearing
for
a
quality
wherein
they
say
you
shine
your
sun
of
parts
did
not
together
pluck
such
envy
from
him
as
did
that
one
and
that
in
my
regard
of
the
unworthiest
siege
laer
what
part
is
that
my
lord
king
a
very
riband
in
the
cap
of
youth
yet
needfull
too
for
youth
no
less
becomes
the
light
and
careless
livery
that
it
wears
thin
settled
age
his
sables
and
his
weeds
importing
health
and
graveness
two
months
since
here
was
a
gentleman
of
normandy
i
have
seen
myself
and
servd
against
the
french
and
they
can
well
on
horseback
but
this
gallant
had
witchcraft
int
he
grew
unto
his
seat
and
to
such
wondrous
doing
brought
his
horse
as
had
he
been
incorpsd
and
deminaturd
with
the
brave
beast
so
far
he
toppd
my
thought
that
i
in
forgery
of
shapes
and
tricks
come
short
of
what
he
did
laer
a
norman
wast
king
a
norman
laer
upon
my
life
lamound
king
the
very
same
laer
i
know
him
well
he
is
the
broach
indeed
and
gem
of
all
the
nation
king
he
made
confession
of
you
and
gave
you
such
a
masterly
report
for
art
and
exercise
in
your
defence
and
for
your
rapier
most
especially
that
he
cried
out
twould
be
a
sight
indeed
if
one
could
match
you
the
scrimers
of
their
nation
he
swore
had
neither
motion
guard
nor
eye
if
you
opposd
them
sir
this
report
of
his
did
hamlet
so
envenom
with
his
envy
that
he
could
nothing
do
but
wish
and
beg
your
sudden
coming
oer
to
play
with
you
now
out
of
this
laer
what
out
of
this
my
lord
king
laertes
was
your
father
dear
to
you
or
are
you
like
the
painting
of
a
sorrow
a
face
without
a
heart
laer
why
ask
you
this
king
not
that
i
think
you
did
not
love
your
father
but
that
i
know
love
is
begun
by
time
and
that
i
see
in
passages
of
proof
time
qualifies
the
spark
and
fire
of
it
there
lives
within
the
very
flame
of
love
a
kind
of
wick
or
snuff
that
will
abate
it
and
nothing
is
at
a
like
goodness
still
for
goodness
growing
to
a
plurisy
dies
in
his
own
toomuch
that
we
would
do
we
should
do
when
we
would
for
this
would
changes
and
hath
abatements
and
delays
as
many
as
there
are
tongues
are
hands
are
accidents
and
then
this
should
is
like
a
spendthrift
sigh
that
hurts
by
easing
but
to
the
quick
o
th
ulcer
hamlet
comes
back
what
would
you
undertake
to
show
yourself
your
fathers
son
in
deed
more
than
in
words
laer
to
cut
his
throat
i
th
church
king
no
place
indeed
should
murther
sanctuarize
revenge
should
have
no
bounds
but
good
laertes
will
you
do
this
keep
close
within
your
chamber
will
returnd
shall
know
you
are
come
home
well
put
on
those
shall
praise
your
excellence
and
set
a
double
varnish
on
the
fame
the
frenchman
gave
you
bring
you
in
fine
together
and
wager
on
your
heads
he
being
remiss
most
generous
and
free
from
all
contriving
will
not
peruse
the
foils
so
that
with
ease
or
with
a
little
shuffling
you
may
choose
a
sword
unbated
and
in
a
pass
of
practice
requite
him
for
your
father
laer
i
will
dot
and
for
that
purpose
ill
anoint
my
sword
i
bought
an
unction
of
a
mountebank
so
mortal
that
but
dip
a
knife
in
it
where
it
draws
blood
no
cataplasm
so
rare
collected
from
all
simples
that
have
virtue
under
the
moon
can
save
the
thing
from
death
this
is
but
scratchd
withal
ill
touch
my
point
with
this
contagion
that
if
i
gall
him
slightly
it
may
be
death
king
lets
further
think
of
this
weigh
what
convenience
both
of
time
and
means
may
fit
us
to
our
shape
if
this
should
fall
and
that
our
drift
look
through
our
bad
performance
twere
better
not
assayd
therefore
this
project
should
have
a
back
or
second
that
might
hold
if
this
did
blast
in
proof
soft
let
me
see
well
make
a
solemn
wager
on
your
cunnings
i
hat
when
in
your
motion
you
are
hot
and
dry
as
make
your
bouts
more
violent
to
that
end
and
that
he
calls
for
drink
ill
have
prepard
him
a
chalice
for
the
nonce
whereon
but
sipping
if
he
by
chance
escape
your
venomd
stuck
our
purpose
may
hold
there
but
stay
what
noise

enter
queen

how
now
sweet
queen
queen
one
woe
doth
tread
upon
anothers
heel
so
fast
they
follow
your
sisters
drownd
laertes
laer
drownd
o
where
queen
there
is
a
willow
grows
aslant
a
brook
that
shows
his
hoar
leaves
in
the
glassy
stream
there
with
fantastic
garlands
did
she
come
of
crowflowers
nettles
daisies
and
long
purples
that
liberal
shepherds
give
a
grosser
name
but
our
cold
maids
do
dead
mens
fingers
call
them
there
on
the
pendant
boughs
her
coronet
weeds
clambring
to
hang
an
envious
sliver
broke
when
down
her
weedy
trophies
and
herself
fell
in
the
weeping
brook
her
clothes
spread
wide
and
mermaidlike
awhile
they
bore
her
up
which
time
she
chaunted
snatches
of
old
tunes
as
one
incapable
of
her
own
distress
or
like
a
creature
native
and
indued
unto
that
element
but
long
it
could
not
be
till
that
her
garments
heavy
with
their

pulld
the
poor

from

too

i
wrote

an
earnest
conjuration
from
the
king
as
england
was
his
faithful
tributary
as
love
between

might
flourish
as

should
still
her
wheaten
garland
wear
and
stand
a
comma

many
suchlike
ass

of
spirit
put
your
bonnet
to
his
right
use
tis
for
the
head
osr
i
thank
your

very
cold
the
wind

northerly
osr

indifferent
cold
my
lord
indeed
ham
but

methinks
it
is
very
sultry
and
hot
for
my
complexion
osr
exceedingly
my
lord
it
is
very
sultry
as
twere
i
cannot
tell
how
but
my

bade

to

that

laid
a
great
wager
on

the
matter

newly
come

laertes
believe
me
an
absolute
gentleman
full
of
most
excellent
differences
of
very
soft
society
and
great
showing
indeed
to
speak
feelingly
of
him
he
is
the
card
or
calendar
of
gentry
for
you
shall
find
in
him
the
continent
of
what
part
a
gentleman
would
see
ham
sir
his
definement
suffers
no
perdition
in
you
though
i
know
to
divide
him
inventorially
would
dozy
th
arithmetic
of
memory
and
yet
but
yaw
neither
in
respect
of
his
quick
sail
but
in
the
verity
of
extolment
i
take
him
to
be
a
soul
of
great
article
and
his
infusion
of
such
dearth
and
rareness
as
to
make
true
diction
of
him
his
semblable
is
his
mirror
and
who
else
would
trace
him
his
umbrage
nothing
more
osr
your
lordship
speaks
most
infallibly
of
him
ham
the
concernancy
sir
why
do
we
wrap
the
gentleman
in
our
more
rawer
breath
osr
sir
hor
aside
to
hamlet
ist
not
possible
to
understand
in
another
tongue
you
will
dot

imports
the
nomination
of
this
gentleman
osr
of
laertes

alls
golden
words
are
spent
ham
of
him
sir
osr
i
know
you

ham
i
would
you
did

yet
in
faith
if

not
much
approve
me
well
sir
osr
you
are
not
ignorant
of
what
excellence
laertes
is
ham
i
dare
not
confess
that
lest
i
should
compare
with
him
in
excellence
but
to
know
a
man
well
were
to
know
himself
osr
i
mean
sir
for
his
weapon
but
in
the
imputation
laid
on

by
them
in
his
meed
hes
unfellowed
ham
whats
his
weapon

of

which
he
has
impond
as
i
take
it
six
french
rapiers
and
poniards
with
their
assigns
as
girdle
hangers

three
of

hangers

the
phrase
would
be
more
germane
to
the
matter

could
carry
cannon
by
our
sides
i
would
it
might
be
hangers
till
then
but
on
six
barbary
horses
against
six
french
swords

jump
upon
this
bloody
question
you
from
the
polack
wars
and
you
from
england
are
here
arrivd
give
order
that
these
bodies
high
on
a
stage
be
placed
to
the
view
and
let
me
speak
to
the
yet
unknowing
world
how
these
things
came
about
so
shall
you
hear
of
carnal
bloody
and
unnatural
acts
of
accidental
judgments
casual
slaughters
of
deaths
put
on
by
cunning
and
forcd
cause
and
in
this
upshot
purposes
mistook
falln
on
th
inventors
heads
all
this
can
i
truly
deliver
fort
let
us
haste
to
hear
it
and
call
the
noblest
to
the
audience
for
me
with
sorrow
i
embrace
my
fortune
i
have
some
rights
of
memory
in
this
kingdom
which
now
to
claim
my
vantage
doth
invite
me
hor
of
that
i
shall
have
also
cause
to
speak
and
from
his
mouth
whose
voice
will
draw
on
more
but
let
this
same
be
presently
performd
even
while
mens
minds
are
wild
lest
more
mischance
on
plots
and
errors
happen
fort
let
four
captains
bear
hamlet
like
a
soldier
to
the
stage
for
he
was
likely
had
he
been
put
on
to
have
provd
most
royally
and
for
his
passage
the
soldiers
music
and
the
rites
of
war
speak
loudly
for
him
take
up
the
bodies
such
a
sight
as
this
becomes
the
field
but
here
shows
much
amiss
go
bid
the
soldiers
shoot
exeunt
marching
after
the
which
a
peal
of
ordnance
are
shot
off

let

hear
of
you
my
gentle
cousin
westmoreland
what
yesternight
our
council
did
decree
in
forwarding
this
dear
expedience
west
my
liege
this
haste
was
hot
in
question
and
many
limits
of
the
charge
set
down
but
yesternight
when
all
athwart
there
came
a
post
from
wales
loaden
with
heavy
news
whose
worst
was
that
the
noble
mortimer
leading
the
men
of
herefordshire
to
fight
against
the
irregular
and
wild
glendower
was
by
the
rude
hands
of
that
welshman
taken
a
thousand
of
his
people
butchered
upon
whose
dead
corpse
there
was
such
misuse
such
beastly
shameless
transformation
by
those
welshwomen
done
as
may
not
be
without
much
shame
retold
or
spoken
of
king
it
seems
then
that
the
tidings
of
this
broil
brake
off
our
business
for
the
holy
land
west
this
matchd
with
other
did
my
gracious
lord
for
more
uneven
and
unwelcome
news
came
from
the
north
and
thus
it
did
import
on
holyrood
day
the
gallant
hotspur
there
young
harry
percy
and
brave
archibald
that
evervaliant
and
approved
scot
at
holmedon
met
where
they
did
spend
a
sad
and
bloody
hour
as
by
discharge
of
their
artillery
and
shape
of
likelihood
the
news
was
told
for
he
that
brought
them
in
the
very
heat
and
pride
of
their
contention

pride
whilst
i
by
looking
on
the
praise
of
him
see
riot
and
dishonour
stain
the
brow
of
my
young
harry
o
that
it
could
be
provd
that
some
nighttripping
fairy
had
exchangd
in
cradle
clothes
our
children
where
they
lay
and
calld
mine
percy

i
have
his
harry

let
him
from

thoughts
what
think
you
coz
of
this
young

prisoners
which
he
in
this

his
own
use

mordake

west
this
is
his
uncles
teaching
this

to
you
in
all
aspects
which
makes
him
prune
himself
and
bristle
up
the
crest
of
youth
against
your
dignity

but
i
have
sent
for
him
to
answer
this
and
for
this
cause

now
my
good
sweet
honey
lord
ride
with

tomorrow
i
have
a
jest
to
execute
that
i
cannot
manage
alone
falstaff
bardolph
peto
and
gadshill
shall
rob
those
men
that
we
have
already
waylaid
yourself
and
i
will
not

there
and
when
they
have
the
booty
if
you
and
i
do
not
rob
them
cut
this
head
off
from
my
shoulders
prince
how
shall
we
part
with
them
in
setting
forth
poins
why
we
will
set
forth
before
or
after
them
and
appoint
them
a
place
of
meeting
wherein
it
is
at
our
pleasure
to
fail
and
then
will
they
adventure
upon
the
exploit
themselves
which
they
shall
have
no
sooner
achieved
but
well
set
upon
them
prince
yea
but
tis
like
that
they
will
know
us
by
our
horses
by
our
habits
and
by
every
other
appointment
to
be
ourselves
poins
tut
our
horses
they
shall
not
see
ill
tie
them
in
the
wood
our
wizards
we
will
change
after
we
leave
them
and
sirrah
i
have
cases
of
buckram
for
the
nonce
to
immask
our
noted
outward
garments
prince
yea
but
i
doubt
they
will
be
too
hard
for
us
poins
well
for
two
of
them
i
know
them
to
be
as
truebred
cowards
as
ever
turnd
back
and
for
the
third
if
he
fight
longer
than
he
sees
reason
ill
forswear
arms
the
virtue
of
this
jest
will
lie
the
incomprehensible
lies
that
this
same
fat
rogue
will
tell
us
when
we
meet
at
supper
how
thirty
at
least
he
fought
with
what
wards
what
blows
what
extremities
he
endured
and
in
the
reproof
of
this
lies
the
jest
prince
well
ill
go
with
thee
provide
us
all
things
necessary
and
meet
me
tonight
in

i
know
you

awhile

of

will
i
imitate
the
sun
who
doth
permit
the
base
contagious
clouds
to
smother
up
his
beauty
from
the
world
that
when
he
please
again
to
lie
himself
being
wanted
he
may
be
more
wondred
at
by
breaking
through
the
foul
and
ugly
mists
of
vapours
that
did
seem
to
strangle
him
if
all
the

were
playing

would
be

tedious
as

when

when

i
throw
off

never

hath
been

temperate
unapt
to

at

indignities
and
you
have
found
me
for
accordingly
you
tread
upon
my
patience
but
be
sure
i
will
from
henceforth
rather
be
myself
mighty
and

than
my

hath
been
smooth
as

soft
as
young

and
therefore
lost
that
title
of
respect
which
the
proud
soul
neer
pays

to
the
proud
wor
our

my

little

get
thee
gone
for
i
do
see
danger
and
disobedience
in
thine
eye
o
sir
your
presence
is
too
bold
and
peremptory
and

moody
frontier
of
a

you
were
about
to

north
yea
my
good
lord
those
prisoners
in
your
highness
name
demanded
which
harry
percy
here
at
holmedon
took
were
as
he
says
not
with
such
strength
denied
as
is
delivered
to
your
majesty
either
envy
therefore
or
misprision
is
guilty
of
this
fault
and
not
my
son
hot
my
liege
i
did
deny
no
prisoners
but
i
remember
when
the
fight
was
done
when
i
was
dry
with
rage
and
extreme
toll
breathless
and
faint
leaning
upon
my
sword
came
there
a
certain
lord
neat
and
trimly
dressd
fresh
as
a
bridegroom
and
his
chin
new
reapd
showd
like
a
stubble
land
at
harvest
home
he
was
perfumed
like
a
milliner
and
twixt
his
finger
and
his
thumb
he
held
a
pouncet
box
which
ever
and
anon
he
gave
his
nose
and
tookt
away
again
who
therewith
angry
when
it
next
came
there
took
it
in
snuff
and
still
he
smild
and
talkd
and
as
the
soldiers
bore
dead
bodies
by
he
calld
them
untaught
knaves
unmannerly
to
bring
a
slovenly
unhandsome
corse
betwixt
the
wind
and
his
nobility
with
many
holiday
and
lady
terms
he
questioned
me
amongst
the
rest
demanded
my
prisoners
in
your
majestys
behalf
i
then
all
smarting
with
my
wounds
being
cold
to
be
so
pestred
with
a
popingay
out
of
my
grief
and
my
impatience
answerd
neglectingly
i
know
not
what
he
should
or
he
should
not
for
he
made
me
mad
to
see
him
shine
so
brisk
and
smell
so
sweet
and
talk
so
like
a
waiting
gentlewoman
of
guns
and
drums
and
wounds
god
save
the
mark
and
telling
me
the
sovereignest
thing
on
earth
was
parmacity
for
an
inward
bruise
and
that
it
was
great
pity
so
it
was
this
villanous
saltpetre
should
be
diggd
out
of
the
bowels
of
the
harmless
earth
which
many
a
good
tall
fellow
had
destroyd
so
cowardly
and
but
for
these
vile
guns
he
would
himself
have
been
a
soldier
this
bald
unjointed
chat
of
his
my
lord
i
answered
indirectly
as
i
said
and
i
beseech
you
let
not
his
report
come
current
for
an
accusation
betwixt
my
love
and
your
high
majesty
blunt
the
circumstance
considered
good
my
lord
whateer
lord
harry
percy
then
had
said
to
such
a
person
and
in
such
a
place
at
such
a
time
with
all
the
rest
retold
may
reasonably
die
and
never
rise
to
do
him
wrong
or
any
way
impeach
what
then
he
said
so
he
unsay
it
now
king
why
yet
he
doth
deny
his
prisoners
but
with
proviso
and
exception
that
we
at
our
own
charge
shall
ransom
straight
his
brotherinlaw
the
foolish
mortimer
who
on
my
soul
hath
wilfully
betrayd
the
lives
of
those
that
he
did
lead
to
fight
against
that
great
magician
damnd
glendower
whose
daughter
as
we
hear
the
earl
of
march
hath
lately
married
shall
our
coffers
then
be
emptied
to
redeem
a
traitor
home
shall
we
buy
treason
and
indent
with
fears
when
they
have
lost
and
forfeited
themselves
no
on
the
barren
mountains
let
him
starve
for
i
shall
never
hold
that
man
my
friend
whose
tongue
shall
ask
me
for
one
penny
cost
to
ransom
home
revolted
mortimer
hot
revolted
mortimer
he
never
did
fall
off
my
sovereign
liege
but
by
the
chance
of
war
to
prove
that
true
needs
no
more
but
one
tongue
for
all
those
wounds
those
mouthed
wounds
which
valiantly
he
took
when
on
the
gentle
severns
sedgy
bank
in
single
opposition
hand
to
hand
he
did
confound
the
best
part
of
an
hour
in
changing
hardiment
with
great
glendower
three
times
they
breathd
and
three
times
did
they
drink
upon
agreement
of
swift
severns
flood
who
then
affrighted
with
their
bloody
looks
ran
fearfully
among
the
trembling
reeds
and
hid
his
crisp
head
in
the
hollow
bank
bloodstained
with
these
valiant
cohabitants
never
did
base
and
rotten
policy
colour
her
working
with
such
deadly
wounds
nor
never
could
the
noble
mortimer
receive
so
many
and
all
willingly

not
him
be
slandered
with
revolt

ill
empty
all
these
veins

drop
in

dust
but
i
will
lift
the
downtrod
mortimer
as
high
in

air
as
this
unthankful
king
as
this
ingrate
and
cankred
bolingbroke
north
brother
the
king
hath
made
your
nephew
mad
wor
who
struck
this
heat
up

forsooth
have
all
my
prisoners
and
when
i
urgd
the
ransom
once
again
of
my
wives
brother
then
his
cheek
lookd
pale
and
on
my
face
he
turnd
an
eye
of
death
trembling
even
at
the
name
of
mortimer
wor
i
cannot
blame
him
was
not
he
proclaimd
by
richard
that
dead
is
the
next
of
blood
north
he
was
i
heard
the
proclamation
and
then
it
was
when
the
unhappy
king
whose
wrongs
in
us
god
pardon
did
set
forth
upon
his
irish
expedition
from
whence
he
intercepted
did
return
to
be
deposd
and
shortly
murdered
wor
and
for
whose
death
we
in
the
worlds
wide
mouth
live
scandalizd
and
foully
spoken
of
hot
but
soft
i
pray
you
did
king
richard
then
proclaim
my
brother
edmund
mortimer
heir
to
the
crown
north
he
did
myself
did
hear
it
hot
nay
then
i
cannot
blame
his
cousin
king
that
wishd
him
on
the
barren
mountains
starve
but
shall
it
be
that
you
that
set
the
crown
upon
the
head
of
this
forgetful
man
and
for
his
sake
wear
the
detested
blot
of
murtherous
subornation
shall
it
be
that
you
a
world
of
curses
undergo
being
the
agents
or
base
second
means
the
cords
the
ladder
or
the
hangman
rather
o
pardon
me
that
i
descend
so
low
to
show
the
line
and
the
predicament
wherein
you
range
under
this
subtile
king
shall
it
for
shame
be
spoken
in
these
days
or
fill
up
chronicles
in
time
to
come
that
men
of
your
nobility
and
power
did
gage
them
both
in
an
unjust
behalf
as
both
of
you
god
pardon
it
have
done
to
put
down
richard
that
sweet
lovely
rose
and
plant
this
thorn
this
canker
bolingbroke
and
shall
it
in
more
shame
be
further
spoken
that
you
are
foold
discarded
and
shook
off
by
him
for
whom
these
shames
ye
underwent
no
yet
time
serves
wherein
you
may
redeem
your
banishd
honours
and
restore
yourselves
into
the
good
thoughts
of
the
world
again
revenge
the
jeering
and
disdaind
contempt
of
this
proud
king

studies
day
and
night
to
answer
all
the
debt
he
owes
to
you
even
with
the
bloody
payment
of
your
deaths
therefore
i
say
wor
peace
cousin
say
no
more
and
now
i
will
unclasp
a
secret
book
and
to
your
quickconceiving
discontents
ill
read
you
matter
deep
and
dangerous
as
full
of
peril
and
adventurous
spirit
as
to
oerwalk
a
current
roaring
loud
on

unsteadfast
footing
of
a
spear
hot
if
he
fall
in

honour
cross
it
from

let

stirs
to
rouse
a
lion
than
to
start
a
hare
north
imagination
of
some
great
exploit
drives
him
beyond
the
bounds
of
patience
hot
by
heaven
methinks
it
were
an
easy
leap
to
pluck
bright
honour
from
the
palefacd
moon
or
dive
into
the
bottom
of
the
deep
where
fadom
line
could
never
touch
the
ground
and
pluck
up
drowned
honour
by
the
locks
so
he
that
doth
redeem
her
thence
might
wear
without
corrival
all
her
dignities
but
out
upon
this
halffacd
fellowship
wor
he
apprehends
a
world
of
figures
here

not
the
form
of
what
he
should
attend

mortimer
nay
ill
have
a

i
speak
not
this

what
i

found
a
time
to
pay

already
how
he
doth
begin

partly
thy

a
villanous
trick

full
of
prosperous
hope
hot

you

sit
good
cousin
hotspur
for
by
that
name
as
oft
as
lancaster
doth
speak
of
you
his
cheek
looks
pale
and
with
a
rising
sigh
he
wisheth
you
in
heaven
hot
and
you
in
hell
as
oft
as
he
hears
owen
glendower
spoke
of
glend
i
cannot
blame
him
at
my
nativity
the
front
of
heaven
was
full
of
fiery
shapes
of
burning
cressets
and
at
my
birth
the
frame
and
huge
foundation
of
the
earth
shakd
like
a
coward
hot
why
so
it
would
have
done
at
the
same
season
if
your
mothers
cat
had
but
kittend
though
yourself
had
never
been
born
glend
i
say
the
earth
did
shake
when
i
was
born
hot
and
i
say
the
earth
was
not
of
my
mind
if
you
suppose
as
fearing
you
it
shook
glend
the
heavens
were
all
on
fire
the
earth
did
tremble
hot
o
then
the
earth
shook
to
see
the
heavens
on
fire
and
not
in
fear
of
your
nativity
diseased
nature
oftentimes
breaks
forth
in
strange
eruptions
oft
the
teeming
earth
is
with
a
kind
of
colic
pinchd
and
vexd
by
the
imprisoning
of
unruly
wind
within
her
womb
which
for
enlargement
striving
shakes
the
old
beldame
earth
and
topples
down
steeples
and
mossgrown
towers
at
your
birth
our
grandam
earth
having
this
distemprature
in
passion
shook
glend
cousin
of
many
men
i
do
not
bear
these
crossings
give
me
leave
to
tell
you
once
again
that
at
my
birth
the
front
of
heaven
was
full
of
fiery
shapes
the
goats
ran
from
the
mountains
and
the
herds
were
strangely
clamorous
to
the
frighted
fields
these
signs
have
markd
me
extraordinary
and
all
the
courses
of
my
life
do
show
i
am
not
in
the
roll
of
common
men
where

he
living
clippd
in

i
am
glad
of

brazen
canstick
turnd

axletree
and
that
would
set
my
teeth

fie
cousin
percy
how
you
cross
my
father
hot
i
cannot
choose
sometimes
he
angers
me
with
telling
me
of
the
moldwarp
and
the
ant
of
the
dreamer
merlin
and
his
prophecies
and
of
a
dragon
and
a
finless
fish
a
clipwingd
griffin
and
a
moulten
raven
a
couching
lion
and
a
ramping
cat
and
such
a
deal
of
skimbleskamble
stuff
as
puts
me
from
my
faith
i
tell
you
what
he
held
me
last
night
at
least
nine
hours
in
reckoning
up
the
several
devils
names
that
were
his
lackeys
i
cried
hum
and
well
go
to
but
markd
him
not
a
word
o
he
is
as
tedious
as
a
tired
horse
a
railing
wife
worse
than
a
smoky
house
i
had
rather
live
with
cheese
and
garlic
in
a
windmill
far
than
feed
on
cates
and
have
him
talk
to
me
in
any
summer
house
in
christendom
mort
in
faith
he
is
a
worthy
gentleman
exceedingly
well
read
and
profited
in
strange
concealments
valiant
as
a
lion
and
wondrous
affable
and
as
bountiful
as
mines
of
india
shall
i
tell
you
cousin
he
holds
your
temper
in
a
high
respect
and
curbs
himself
even
of
his
natural
scope
when
you
come
cross
his
humour
faith
he
does
i
warrant
you
that
man
is
not
alive
might
so
have
tempted
him
as
you
have
done
without
the
taste
of
danger
and
reproof
but
do
not
use
it
oft
let
me
entreat
you
wor
in
faith
my
lord
you
are
too
wilfulblame
and
since
your
coming
hither

done
enough
to
put
him
quite
besides
his
patience

must
needs
learn
lord
to
amend
this
fault
though
sometimes
it
show
greatness
courage
blood
and
thats
the
dearest
grace
it
renders
you
yet
oftentimes
it
doth
present
harsh
rage
defect
of
manners
want
of
government
pride
haughtiness
opinion
and
disdain
the
least
of
which
haunting
a
nobleman
loseth
mens
hearts
and
leaves
behind
a
stain
upon
the
beauty
of
all
parts

beguiling

the

prince
of
wales
and
others

king
lords
give
us
leave
the
prince
of
wales
and
i
must
have
some
private
conference
but
be
near
at
hand
for
we
shall
presently
have
need
of
you
exeunt
lords
i
know
not
whether
god
will
have
it
so
for
some
displeasing
service
i
have
done
that
in
his
secret
doom
out
of
my
blood
hell
breed
revengement
and
a
scourge
for
me
but
thou
dost
in
thy
passages
of
life
make
me
believe
that
thou
art
only
markd
for
the
hot
vengeance
and
the
rod
of
heaven
to
punish
my
mistreadings
tell
me
else
could
such
inordinate
and
low
desires
such
poor
such
bare
such
lewd
such
mean
attempts
such
barren
pleasures
rude
society
as
thou
art
matchd
withal
and
grafted
to
accompany
the
greatness
of
thy
blood
and
hold
their
level
with
thy
princely
heart
prince
so
please
your
majesty
i
would
i
could
quit
all
offences
with
as
clear
excuse
as
well
as
i
am
doubtless
i
can
purge
myself
of
many
i
am
charged
withal
yet
such
extenuation
let
me
beg
as
in
reproof
of
many
tales
devisd
which
oft
the
ear
of
greatness
needs
must
bear
by
smiling
pickthanks
and
base
newsmongers
i
may
for
some
things
true
wherein
my
youth
hath
faulty
wandred
and
irregular
and
pardon
on
lily
true
submission
king
god
pardon
thee
yet
let
me
wonder
harry
at
thy
affections
which
do
hold
a
wing
quite
from
the
flight
of
all
thy
ancestors
thy
place
in
council
thou
hast
rudely
lost
which
by
thy
younger
brother
is
supplied
and
art
almost
an
alien
to
the
hearts
of
all
the
court
and
princes
of
my
blood
the
hope
and
expectation
of
thy
time
is
ruind
and
the
soul
of
every
man
prophetically
do
forethink
thy
fall
had
i
so
lavish
of
my
presence
been
so
commonhackneyd
in
the
eyes
of
men
so
stale
and
cheap
to
vulgar
company
opinion
that
did
help
me
to
the
crown
had
still
kept
loyal
to
possession
and
left
me
in
reputeless
banishment
a
fellow
of
no
mark
nor
likelihood
by
being
seldom
seen
i
could
not
stir
but
like
a
comet
i
was
wondred
at
that
men
would
tell
their
children
this
is
he
others
would
say
where
which
is
bolingbroke
and
then
i
stole
all
courtesy
from
heaven
and
dressd
myself
in
such
humility
that
i
did
pluck
allegiance
from
mens
hearts
loud
shouts
and
salutations
from
their
mouths
even
in
the
presence
of
the
crowned
king
thus
did
i
keep
my
person
fresh
and
new
my
presence
like
a
robe
pontifical
neer
seen
but
wondred
at
and
so
my
state
seldom
but
sumptuous
showd
like
a
feast
and
won
by

profaned
with

i
the
rebel
camp

shrewsbury

enter
harry
hotspur
worcester
and
douglas

hot
well
said
my
noble
scot
if
speaking
truth
in
this
fine
age
were
not
thought
flattery
such
attribution
should
the
douglas
have
as
not
a
soldier
of
this
seasons
stamp
should
go
so
general
current
through
the
world
by
god
i
cannot
flatter
i
defy
the
tongues
of
soothers
but
a
braver
place
in
my
hearts
love
hath
no
man
than
yourself
nay
task
me
to
my
word
approve
me
lord
doug
thou
art
the
king
of
honour
no
man
so
potent
breathes
upon
the
ground
but
i
will
beard
him

enter
one
with
letters

hot
do
so
and
tis
well
what
letters
hast
thou
there
i
can
but
thank
you
messenger
these
letters
come
from
your
father
hot
letters
from
him
why
comes
he
not
himself
mess
he
cannot
come
my
lord
he
is
grievous
sick
hot
zounds
how
has
he
the
leisure
to
be
sick
in
such
a
justling
time
who
leads
his
power
under
whose
government
come
they
along
mess
his
letters
bears
his
mind
not
i
my
lord
wor
i
prithee
tell
me
doth
he
keep
his
bed
mess
he
did
my
lord
four
days
ere
i
set
forth
and
at
the
time
of
my
departure
thence
he
was
much
feard
by
his
physicians
wor
i
would
the
state
of
time
had
first
been
whole
ere
he
by
sickness
had
been
visited
his
health
was
never
better
worth
than
now
hot
sick
now
droop
now
this
sickness
doth
infect
the
very
lifeblood
of
our
enterprise
tis
catching
hither
even
to
our
camp
he
writes
me
here
that
inward
sickness
and
that
his
friends
by
deputation
could
not
so
soon
be
drawn
no
did
he
think
it
meet
to
lay
so
dangerous
and
dear
a
trust
on
any
soul
removd
but
on
his
own
yet
doth
he
give
us
bold
advertisement
that
with
our
small
conjunction
we
should
on
to
see
how
fortune
is
disposd
to
us
for
as
he
writes
there
is
no
quailing
now
because
the
king
is
certainly
possessd
of
all
our
purposes
what
say
you
to
it
wor
your
fathers
sickness
is
a
maim
to
us
hot
a
perilous
gash
a
very
limb
loppd
off
and
yet
in
faith
it
is
not
his
present
want
seems
more
than
we
shall
find
it
were
it
good
to
set
the
exact
wealth
of
all
our
states
all
at
one
cast
to
set
so
rich
a
man
on
the
nice
hazard
of
one
doubtful
hour
it
were
not
good
for
therein
should
we
read
the
very
bottom
and
the
soul
of
hope
the
very
list
the
very
utmost
bound
of
all
our
fortunes
doug
faith
and
so
we
should
where
now
remains
a
sweet
reversion
we
may
boldly
spend
upon
the
hope
of
what
is
to
come
in
a
comfort
of
retirement
lives
in
this
hot
a
rendezvous
a
home
to
fly
unto
if
that
the
devil
and
mischance
look
big
upon
the
maidenhead
of
our
affairs
wor
but
yet
i
would
your
father
had
been
here
the
quality
and
hair
of
our
attempt
brooks
no
division
it
will
be
thought
by
some
that
know
not
why
he
is
away
that
wisdom
loyalty
and
mere
dislike
of
our
proceedings
kept
the
earl
from
hence
and
think
how
such
an
apprehension
may
turn
the
tide
of
fearful
faction
and
breed
a
kind
of
question
in
our
cause
for
well
you
know
we
of
the
offring
side
must
keep
aloof
from
strict
arbitrement
and
stop
all
sightholes
every
loop
from
whence
the
eye
of
reason
may
pry
in
upon
us
this
absence
of
your
fathers
draws
a
curtain
that
shows
the
ignorant
a
kind
of
fear
before
not
dreamt
of
hot
you
strain
too
far
i
rather
of
his
absence
make
this
use
it
lends
a
lustre
and
more
great
opinion
a
larger
dare
to
our
great
enterprise
than
if
the
earl
were
here
for
men
must
think
if
we
without
his
help
can
make
a
head
to
push
against
a
kingdom
with
his
help
we
shall
oerturn
it
topsyturvy
down
yet
all
goes
well
yet
all
our
joints
are
whole
doug
as
heart
can
think
there
is
not
such
a
word
spoke
of
in
scotland
as
this
term
of
fear

you
conjure
from

such
bold
hostility

his
duteous
land
audacious
cruelty
if
that
the
king
have
any

deserts

he
confesseth
to

he
bids
you
name
your
griefs
and
with
all
speed
you
shall
have
your
desires
with
interest
and
pardon
absolute
for
yourself
and
these
herein
misled
by
your
suggestion
hot
the
king
is
kind
and
well
we
know
the
king
knows
at
what
time
to
promise
when
to
pay
my
father
and
my
uncle
and
myself
did
give
him
that
same
royalty
he
wears
and
when
he
was
not
sixandtwenty
strong
sick
in
the
worlds
regard
wretched
and
low
a
poor
unminded
outlaw
sneaking
home
my
father
gave
him
welcome
to
the
shore
and
when
he
heard
him
swear
and
vow
to
god
he
came
but
to
be
duke
of
lancaster
to
sue
his
livery
and
beg
his
peace
with
tears
of
innocency
and
terms
of
zeal
my
father
in
kind
heart
and
pity
movd
swore
him
assistance
and
performed
it
too
now
when
the
lords
and
barons
of
the
realm
perceivd
northumberland
did
lean
to
him
the
more
and
less
came
in
with
cap
and
knee
met
him
on
boroughs

villages
attended
him
on
bridges
stood
in
lanes
laid
gifts
before
him
profferd
him
their
oaths
give
him
their
heirs
as
pages
followed
him
even
at
the
heels
in
golden
multitudes
he
presently
as
greatness
knows
itself
steps
me
a
little
higher
than
his
vow
made
to
my
father
while
his
blood
was
poor
upon
the
naked
shore
at
ravenspurgh
and
now
forsooth
takes
on
him
to
reform

too
heavy
on

commonwealth

out
upon
abuses

to
weep
over
his
countrys
wrongs
and
by
this
face
this
seeming
brow

win
the
hearts
of
all

he
did
angle

in
rage
dismissd
my

good
sir

bear
this
sealed
brief
with
winged
haste
to
the
lord

this

my
cousin
scroop
and
all
the
rest
to

if

how
much
they
do
import
you
would
make
haste
sir
m
my
good
lord
i
guess
their
tenour
arch
like
enough
you
do
tomorrow
good
sir
michael
is
a
day
wherein
the
fortune
of
ten
thousand
men
must
bide
the
touch
for
sir
at
shrewsbury
as
i
am
truly
given
to
understand
the
king
with
mighty
and
quickraised
power
meets
with
lord
harry
and
i
fear
sir
michael
what
with
the
sickness
of
northumberland
whose
power
was
in
the
first
proportion
and
what
with
owen
glendowers
absence
thence
who
with
them
was
a
rated
sinew
too
and
comes
not
in
overruld
by
prophecies
i
fear
the
power
of
percy
is
too
weak
to
wage
an
instant
trial
with
the
king
sir
m
why
my
good
lord
you
need
not
fear
there
is
douglas
and
lord
mortimer
arch
no
mortimer
is
not
there
sir
m
but
there
is
mordake
vernon
lord
harry
percy
and
there
is
my
lord
of
worcester
and
a
head
of
gallant
warriors
noble
gentlemen
arch
and
so
there
is
but
yet
the
king
hath
drawn
the
special
head
of
all
the
land
together
the
prince
of
wales
lord
john
of
lancaster
the
noble
westmoreland
and
warlike
blunt

many
moe
corrivals

doubt
not
my

i
hope
no
less
yet
needful
tis
to
fear
and
to
prevent
the
worst
sir
michael
speed
for
if
lord
percy
thrive
not
ere
the
king
dismiss
his
power
he
means
to
visit
us
for
he
hath
heard
of
our
confederacy
and
tis
but
wisdom
to
make
strong
against

therefore
make

blunt
falstaff

king
how
bloodily
the
sun
begins
to
peer
above
yon
busky
hill
the
day
looks
pale
at
his
distemprature
prince
the
southern
wind
doth
play
the
trumpet
to
his
purposes
and
by
his
hollow
whistling
in
the
leaves
foretells
a
tempest
and
a
blustring
day
king
theft
with
the
losers
let
it
sympathize
for
nothing
can
seem
foul
to
those
that
win

the
trumpet
sounds
enter
worcester
and
vernon

how
now
my
lord
of
worcester
tis
not
well
that
you
and
i
should
meet
upon
such
terms
as
now
we
meet
you
have
deceivd
our
trust
and
made
us
doff
our
easy
robes
of
peace
to
crush
our
old
limbs
in
ungentle
steel
this
is
not
well
my
lord
this
is
not
well
what
say
you
to
it
will
you
again
unknit
this
churlish
knot
of
allabhorred
war
and
move
in
that
obedient
orb
again
where
you
did
give
a
fair
and
natural
light
and
be
no
more
an
exhald
meteor
a
prodigy
of
fear
and
a
portent
of
broached
mischief
to
the
unborn
times
wor
hear
me
my
liege
for
mine
own
part
i
could
be
well
content
to
entertain
the
lagend
of
my
life
with
quiet
hours
for
i
do
protest
i
have
not
sought
the
day
of
this
dislike
king
you
have
not
sought
it
how
comes
it
then
fal
rebellion
lay
in
his
way
and
he
found
it
prince
peace
chewet
peace
wor
it
pleasd
your
majesty
to
turn
your
looks
of
favour
from
myself
and
all
our
house
and
yet
i
must
remember
you
my
lord
we
were
the
first
and
dearest
of
your
friends
for
you
my
staff
of
office
did
i
break
in
richards
time
and
posted
day
and
night
to
meet
you
on
the
way
and
kiss
your
hand
when
yet
you
were
in
place
and
in
account
nothing
so
strong
and
fortunate
as
i
it
was
myself
my
brother
and
his
son
that
brought
you
home
and
boldly
did
outdare
the
dangers
of
the
time
you
swore
to
us
and
you
did
swear
that
oath
at
doncaster
that
you
did
nothing
purpose
gainst
the
state
nor
claim
no
further
than
your
newfalln
right
the
seat
of
gaunt
dukedom
of
lancaster
to
this
we
swore
our
aid
but
in
short
space
it
it
raind
down
fortune
showring
on
your
head
and
such
a
flood
of
greatness
fell
on
you
what
with
our
help
what
with
the
absent
king
what
with
the
injuries
of
a
wanton
time
the
seeming
sufferances
that
you
had
borne
and
the
contrarious
winds
that
held
the
king
so
long
in
his
unlucky
irish
wars
that
all
in
england
did
repute
him
dead
and
from
this
swarm
of
fair
advantages
you
took
occasion
to
be
quickly
wood
to
gripe
the
general
sway
into
your
hand
forgot
your
oath
to
us
at
doncaster
and
being
fed
by
us
you
usd
us
so
as
that
ungentle
gull
the
cuckoos
bird
useth
the
sparrow
did
oppress
our
nest
grew
by
our
feeding
to
so
great
a
bulk
that
even
our
love
thirst
not
come
near
your
sight
for
fear
of
swallowing
but
with
nimble
wing
we
were
enforcd
for
safety
sake
to
fly
out
of
your
sight
and
raise
this
present
head
whereby
we
stand
opposed
by
such
means
as
you
yourself
have
forgd
against
yourself
by
unkind
usage
dangerous
countenance
and
violation
of
all
faith
and
troth
sworn
to
tis
in
your
younger
enterprise
king
these
things
indeed
you
have
articulate
proclaimd
at
market
crosses
read
in
churches
to
face
the
garment
of
rebellion
with
some
fine
colour
that
may
please
the
eye
of
fickle
changelings
and
poor
discontents
which
gape
and
rub
the
elbow
at
the
news
of
hurlyburly
innovation
and
never
yet
did
insurrection
want
such
water
colours
to
impaint
his
cause
nor
moody
beggars
starving
for
a
time
of
pellmell
havoc
and
confusion
prince
in
both
our
armies
there
is
many
a
soul
shall
pay
full
dearly
for
this
encounter
if
once
they
join
in
trial
tell
your
nephew
the
prince
of
wales
doth
join
with
all
the
world
in
praise
of
henry
percy
by
my
hopes
this
present
enterprise
set
off
his
head
i
do
not
think
a
braver
gentleman
more
activevaliant
or
more
valiantyoung
more
daring
or
more
bold
is
now
alive
to
grace
this
latter
age
with
noble
deeds
for
my
part
i
may
speak
it
to
my
shame
i
have
a
truant
been
to
chivalry
and
so
i
hear
he
doth
account
me
too
yet
this
before
my
fathers
majesty
i
am
content
that
he
shall
take
the
odds
of
his
great
name
and
estimation
and
will
to
save
the
blood
on
either
side
try
fortune
with
him
in
a
single
fight
king
and
prince
of
wales
so
dare
we
venture
thee
albeit
considerations
infinite
do
make
against
it
no
good
worcester
no
we
love
our
people
well
even
those
we
love
that
are
misled
upon
your
cousins
part
and
will
they
take
the
offer
of
our
grace
both
he
and
they
and
you
yea
every
man
shall
be
my
friend
again
and
ill
be
his
so
tell
your
cousin
and
bring
me
word
what
he
will
do
but
if
he
will
not
yield
rebuke
and
dread
correction
wait
on
us
and
they
shall
do
their
office
so
be
gone
we
will
not
now
be
troubled
with
reply

offer
fair
take
it
advisedly
exit
worcester
with
vernon
prince
it
will
not
be
accepted
on
my
life
the
douglas
and
the
hotspur
both
together
are
confident
against
the
world
in
arms
king
hence
therefore
every
leader

his
charge
for
on
their
answer
will
we
set
on

our
cause

fal
tis
not
due
yet
i
would
be
loath
to
pay
him
before
his
day
what
need
i
be
so
forward
with
him
that
calls
not
on
me
well
tis
no
matter
honour
pricks
me
on
yea
but
how
if
honour
prick
me
off
when
i
come
on
how
then
can
honor
set
to
a
leg
no
or
an
arm
no
or
take
away
the
grief
of
a
wound
no
honour
hath
no
skill
in
surgery
then
no
what
is
honour
a
word
what
is
that
word
honour

trim

that

a
princely
tongue

you
ever
better

still
dispraising
praise
valued
with
you

which
became
him
like
a
prince

made
a
blushing
cital
of
himself

his
truant
youth

such
a
grace
as

a
double
spirit
of

of
learning
