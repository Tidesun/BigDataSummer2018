titus
ah
lucius
for
thy
brothers
let
me
plead
grave
tribunes
once
more
i
entreat
of
you
lucius
my
gracious
lord
no
tribune
hears
you
speak
titus
why
tis
no
matter
man
if
they
did
hear
they
would
not
mark
me
if
they
did
mark
they
would
not
pity
me
yet
plead
i
must
and
bootless
unto
them
therefore
i
tell
my
sorrows
to
the
stones
who
though
they
cannot
answer
my
distress
yet
in
some
sort
they
are
better
than
the
tribunes
for
that
they
will
not
intercept
my
tale
when
i
do
weep
they
humbly
at
my
feet
receive
my
tears
and
seem
to
weep
with
me
and
were
they
but
attired
in
grave
weeds
rome
could
afford
no
tribunes
like
to
these
a
stone
is
soft
as
wax
tribunes
more
hard
than
stones
a
stone
is
silent
and
offendeth
not
and
tribunes
with
their
tongues
doom
men
to
death
rises
but
wherefore
standst
thou
with
thy
weapon
drawn
lucius
to
rescue
my
two
brothers
from
their
death
for
which
attempt
the
judges
have
pronouncd
my
everlasting
doom
of
banishment
titus
o
happy
man
they
have
befriended
thee
why
foolish
lucius
dost
thou
not
perceive
that
rome
is
but
a
wilderness
of
tigers
tigers
must
prey
and
rome
affords
no
prey
but
me
and
mine
how
happy
art
thou
then
from
these
devourers
to
be
banished
but
who
comes
with
our
brother
marcus
here

enter
marcus
with
lavinia

marcus
titus
prepare
thy
aged
eyes
to
weep
or
if
not
so
thy
noble
heart
to
break
i
bring
consuming
sorrow
to
thine
age
titus
will
it
consume
me
let
me
see
it
then
marcus
this
was
thy
daughter
titus
why
marcus
so
she
is
lucius
ay
me
this
object
kills
me
titus
fainthearted
boy
arise
and
look
upon
her
speak
lavinia
what
accursed
hand
hath
made
thee
handless
in
thy
fathers
sight
what
fool
hath
added
water
to
the
sea
or
brought
a
fagot
to
brightburning
troy
my
grief
was
at
the
height
before
thou
camst
and
now
like
nilus
it
disdaineth
bounds
give
me
a
sword
ill
chop
off
my
hands
too
for
they
have
fought
for
rome
and
all
in
vain
and
they
have
nursd
this
woe
in
feeding
life
in
bootless
prayer
have
they
been
held
up
and
they
have
servd
me
to
effectless
use
now
all
the
service
i
require
of
them
is
that
the
one
will
help
to
cut
the
other
tis
well
lavinia
that
thou
hast
no
hands
for
hands
to
do
rome
service
is
but
vain
lucius
speak
gentle
sister
who
hath
martyrd
thee
marcus
o
that
delightful
engine
of
her
thoughts
that
blabbd
them
with
such
pleasing
eloquence
is
torn
from
forth
that
pretty
hollow
cage
where
like
a
sweet
melodious
bird
it
sung
sweet
varied
notes
enchanting
every
ear
lucius
o
say
thou
for
her
who
hath
done
this
deed
marcus
o
thus
i
found
her
straying
in
the
park
seeking
to
hide
herself
as
doth
the
deer
that
hath
receivd
some
unrecuring
wound
titus
it
was
my
dear
and
he
that
wounded
her
hath
hurt
me
more
than
had
he
killd
me
dead
for
now
i
stand
as
one
upon
a
rock
environd
with
a
wilderness
of
sea
who
marks
the
waxing
tide
grow
wave
by
wave
expecting
ever
when
some
envious
surge
will
in
his
brinish
bowels
swallow
him
this
way
to
death
my
wretched
sons
are
gone
here
stands
my
other
son
a
banishd
man
and
here
my
brother
weeping
at
my
woes
but
that
which
gives
my
soul
the
greatest
spurn
is
dear
lavinia
dearer
than
my
soul
had
i
but
seen
thy
picture
in
this
plight
it
would
have
madded
me
what
shall
i
do
now
i
behold
thy
lively
body
so
thou
hast
no
hands
to
wipe
away
thy
tears
nor
tongue
to
tell
me
who
hath
martyrd
thee
thy
husband
he
is
dead
and
for
his
death
thy
brothers
are
condemnd
and
dead
by
this
look
marcus
ah
son
lucius
look
on
her
when
i
did
name
her
brothers
then
fresh
tears
stood
on
her
cheeks
as
doth
the
honey
dew
upon
a
gathred
lily
almost
withered
marcus
perchance
she
weeps
because
they
killd
her
husband
perchance
because
she
knows
them
innocent
titus
if
they
did
kill
thy
husband
then
be
joyful
because
the
law
hath
taen
revenge
on
them
no
no
they
would
not
do
so
foul
a
deed
witness
the
sorrow
that
their
sister
makes
gentle
lavinia
let
me
kiss
thy
lips
or
make
some
sign
how
i
may
do
thee
ease
shall
thy
good
uncle
and
thy
brother
lucius
and
thou
and
i
sit
round
about
some
fountain
looking
all
downwards
to
behold
our
cheeks
how
they
are
staind
like
meadows
yet
not
dry
with
miry
slime
left
on
them
by
a
flood
and
in
the
fountain
shall
we
gaze
so
long
till
the
fresh
taste
be
taken
from
that
clearness
and
made
a
brinepit
with
our
bitter
tears
or
shall
we
cut
away
our
hands
like
thine
or
shall
we
bite
our
tongues
and
in
dumb
shows
pass
the
remainder
of
our
hateful
days
what
shall
we
do
let
us
that
have
our
tongues
plot
some
device
of
further
misery
to
make
us
wonderd
at
in
time
to
come
lucius
sweet
father
cease
your
tears
for
at
your
grief

very
thoughts
of
it
let
fools
do
good
and
fair
men
call
for
grace
aaron
will
have
his
soul
black
like
his
face










exit
titus
o
here
i
lift
this
one
hand
up
to
heaven
and
bow
this
feeble
ruin
to
the
earth
if
any
power
pities
wretched
tears
to
that
i
call

to
lavinia

what
wouldst
thou
kneel
with
me
do
then
dear
heart
for
heaven
shall
hear
our
prayers
or
with
our
sighs
well
breathe
the
welkin
dim
and
stain
the
sun
with
fog
as
sometime
clouds
when
they
do
hug
him
in
their
melting
bosoms
marcus
o
brother
speak
with
possibility
and
do
not
break
into
these
deep
extremes
titus
is
not
my
sorrow
deep
having
no
bottom
then
be
my
passions
bottomless
with
them
marcus
but
yet
let
reason
govern
thy
lament
titus
if
there
were
reason
for
these
miseries
then
into
limits
could
i
bind
my
woes
when
heaven
doth
weep
doth
not
the
earth
oerflow
if
the
winds
rage
doth
not
the
sea
wax
mad
threatning
the
welkin
with
his
bigswoln
face
and
wilt
thou
have
a
reason
for
this
coil
i
am
the
sea
hark
how
her
sighs
do
blow
she
is
the
weeping
welkin
i
the
earth
then
must
my
sea
be
moved
with
her
sighs
then
must
my
earth
with
her
continual
tears
become
a
deluge
overflowd
and
drownd
for
why
my
bowels
cannot
hide
her
woes
but
like
a
drunkard
must
i
vomit
them
then
give
me
leave
for
losers
will
have
leave
to
ease
their
stomachs
with
their
bitter
tongues

enter
a
messenger
with
two
heads
and
a

messenger
worthy
andronicus
ill
art
thou
repaid

that
good
hand

the
heads
of
thy
two
noble
sons
and
heres
thy
hand
in
scorn
to
thee
sent
back
thy
grief
their
sports
thy
resolution
mockd
that
woe
is
me
to
think
upon
thy
woes
more
than
remembrance
of
my
fathers
death












exit

hot
aetna
cool
in
sicily
and
be
my
heart
an
everburning
hell
these
miseries
are
more
than
may
be
borne
to
weep
with
them
that
weep
doth
ease
some
deal
but
sorrow
flouted
at
is
double
death
lucius
ah
that
this
sight
should
make
so
deep
a
wound
and
yet
detested
life
not
shrink
thereat
that
ever
death
should
let
life
bear
his
name
where
life
hath
no
more
interest
but
to
breathe
lavinia
kisses
titus
marcus
alas
poor
heart
that
kiss
is
comfortless
as
frozen
water
to
a
starved
snake
titus
when
will
this
fearful
slumber
have
an
end
marcus
now
farewell
flattry

and
bloodless

thy
brother

a
stony

and
numb

no
more
will

control
thy
griefs
rent
off
thy
silver
hair
thy
other
hand
gnawing
with
thy
teeth
and
be
this
dismal
sight
the
closing
up
of
our
most
wretched
eyes
now
is
a
time
to
storm
why
art
thou

why
dost
thou
laugh

fits
not
with
this
hour

i
have
not
another
tear
to
shed
besides
this
sorrow
is
an
enemy
and
would
usurp
upon
my
watry
eyes
and
make
them
blind
with
tributary
tears
then
which
way
shall
i
find
revenges
cave
for

seem
to
speak
to
me
and
threat
me

titus
she
loves
thee
boy
too
well
to
do
thee
harm
boy
ay
when
my
father
was
in
rome
she
did
marcus
what
means
my
niece
lavinia
by
these
signs
titus
fear
her
not
lucius
somewhat
doth
she
mean
see
lucius

how
much
she
makes
of

somewhither
would
she
have
thee
go
with
her
ah
boy
cornelia

with
more
care
read
to
her
sons
than
she
hath
read
to
thee
sweet
poetry
and
tullys
orator
marcus
canst
thou
not
guess
wherefore
she
plies
thee
thus
boy
my
lord
i
know
not
i
nor
can
i
guess
unless
some
fit
or
frenzy
do
possess
her
for
i
have
heard
my
grandsire
say
full
oft
extremity
of
griefs
would
make
men
mad
and
i
have
read
that
hecuba
of
troy
ran
mad
for
sorrow
that
made
me
to
fear
although
my
lord
i
know
my
noble
aunt
loves
me
as
dear
as
eer
my
mother
did
and
would
not
but
in
fury
fright
my
youth
which
made
me
down
to
throw
my
books
and
fly
causeless
perhaps

thy
sorrow
till
the
heavens

the
damnd

thy
spirit
for

thou
emperor
i
will
enchant
the
old
andronicus
with
words
more
sweet

more
dangerous

honeystalks
to
sheep
when
as
the
one
is
wounded
with
the
bait
the
other
rotted
with

golden

keeps
the
oath

by
that
god

on
the
empress
lucius
o
most
insatiate
and
luxurious
woman
aaron
tut
lucius
this
was
but
a
deed
of
charity
to
that
which
thou
shalt
hear
of
me
anon
twas
her
two
sons
that
murdered
bassianus
they
cut
thy
sisters
tongue
and
ravishd
her
and
cut
her
hands
and
trimmd
her
as
thou
sawest
lucius
o
detestable
villain
callst
thou
that
trimming
aaron
why
she
was
washd
and
cut
and
trimmd
and
twas
trim
sport
for
them
which
had
the
doing
of
it
lucius
o
barbarous
beastly
villains
like
thyself
aaron
indeed
i
was
their
tutor
to
instruct
them
that
codding
spirit
had
they
from
their
mother
as
sure
a
card
as
ever
won
the
set
that
bloody
mind
i
think
they
learnd
of
me
as
true
a
dog
as
ever
fought
at
head
well
let
my
deeds
be
witness
of
my
worth
i
traind
thy
brethren
to
that
guileful
hole
where
the
dead
corpse
of
bassianus
lay
i
wrote
the
letter
that
thy
father
found
and
hid
the
gold
within
that
letter
mentiond
confederate
with
the
queen
and
her
two
sons
and
what
not
done
that
thou
hast
cause
to
rue
wherein
i
had
no
stroke
of
mischief
in
it
i
playd
the
cheater
for
thy
fathers
hand
and
when
i
had
it
drew
myself
apart
and
almost
broke
my
heart
with
extreme
laughter
i
pried
me
through
the
crevice
of
a
wall
when
for
his
hand
he
had
his
two
sons
heads
beheld
his
tears
and
laughd
so
heartily
that
both
mine
eyes
were
rainy
like
to
his
and
when
i
told
the
empress
of
this
sport
she
swooned
almost
at
my
pleasing
tale
and
for
my
tidings
gave
me
twenty
kisses
goth
what
canst
thou
say
all
this
and
never
blush
aaron
ay
like
a
black
dog
as
the
saying

not
sorry
for
these
heinous
deeds
aaron
ay
that
i
had
not
done
a
thousand
more
even
now

curse
the
day
and
yet
i
think
few
come
within
the
compass
of
my
curse

i
did
not
some
notorious
ill
as
kill
a
man
or
else
devise
his
death
ravish
a
maid
or
plot
the
way

deadly
enmity
between
two
friends
make
poor
mens
cattle
break
their
necks
set
fire
on
barns
and
haystacks
in
the
night
and
bid
the
owners
quench
them
with
their
tears
oft
have
i
diggd
up
dead
men
from
their
graves
and
set
them
upright
at
their
dear
friends
door
even
when
their
sorrows

on
their
skins
as
on
the
bark

with
my
knife
carved
in
roman
letters
let

thousand
dreadful
things

me
heartily

that
i
cannot
do
ten

must
not

so
sweet
a
death
as
hanging
presently

our
rome
the
civil
wound
my
heart
is
not
compact
of
flint
nor
steel
nor
can
i
utter
all
our
bitter
grief

floods
of

to
tell
you
fair
beholders
that
our
play
leaps
oer
the
vaunt
and
firstlings
of
those
broils
beginning
in
the
middle
starting
thence
away
to
what
may
be
digested
in
a
play
like
or
find
fault
do
as
your
pleasures
are
now
good
or
bad
tis
but

chance
of

of
his
heart
let
him

troilus
alas

none
pandarus
will
this

troilus
the
greeks
are
strong
and
skilful
to
their
strength
fierce
to
their
skill
and
to
their
fierceness
valiant
but
i
am
weaker
than
a
womans
tear
tamer
than
sleep
fonder
than
ignorance
less
valiant
than
the
virgin
in
the
night
and
skilless
as
unpractisd
infancy
pandarus
well
i
have
told
you
enough
of
this
for
my
part
ill
not
meddle
nor
make
no
farther
he
that
will
have
a
cake
out
of
the
wheat
must
needs
tarry
the
grinding
troilus
have
i
not
tarried
pandarus
ay
the
grinding
but
you
must
tarry
the
bolting
troilus
have
i
not
tarried
pandarus
ay
the
bolting
but
you
must
tarry
the
leavening
troilus
still
have
i
tarried
pandarus
ay
to
the
leavening
but
heres
yet
in
the
word
hereafter
the
kneading
the
making
of
the
cake
the
heating
of
the
oven
and
the
baking
nay
you
must
stay
the
cooling
too
or
you
may
chance
to
burn
your
lips
troilus
patience
herself
what
goddess
eer
she
be
doth
lesser
blench
at
suffrance
than
i
do
at
priams
royal
table
do
i
sit
and
when
fair
cressid
comes
into
my
thoughts
so
traitor
then
she
comes
when
she
is
thence
pandarus
well
she
lookd
yesternight
fairer
than
ever
i
saw
her
look
or
any
woman
else
troilus
i
was
about
to
tell
thee
when
my
heart
as
wedged
with
a
sigh
would
rive
in
twain
lest
hector
or
my
father
should
perceive
me
i
have
as
when
the
sun
doth
light
a
storm
buried
this
sigh
in
wrinkle
of
a
smile
but
sorrow
that
is
couchd
in
seeming
gladness
is
like
that
mirth
fate
turns
to
sudden
sadness
pandarus
an
her
hair
were
not
somewhat
darker
than
helens
well
go
to
there
were
no
more
comparison
between
the
women
but
for
my
part
she
is
my
kinswoman
i
would
not
as
they
term
it
praise
her
but
i
would
somebody
had
heard
her
talk
yesterday
as
i
did
i

will
not
dispraise
your
sister
cassandras
wit
but
troilus
o
pandarus
i
tell
thee
pandarus
when
i
do
tell
thee
there
my
hopes

thy
discourse
o
that
her
hand
in
whose
comparison
all
whites
are
ink
writing
their
own
reproach
to
whose
soft
seizure
the
cygnets
down
is
harsh
and
spirit
of
sense
hard
as
the
palm
of
ploughman
this
thou
tellst
me
as
true
thou
tellst
me
when
i
say
i
love
her
but
saying
thus
instead
of
oil
and
balm

layst
in
every
gash
that
love
hath
given
me
the
knife
that
made

to
the
eastern

whose
height
commands
as
subject
all
the
vale
to
see
the
battle
hector
whose
patience
is
as
a
virtue
fixd
today
was
movd
he
chid
andromache
and
struck
his
armourer
and
like
as
there
were
husbandry
in
war
before
the
sun
rose
he
was
harnessd
light
and
to
the
field
goes
he
where
every
flower
did
as
a
prophet
weep
what
it
foresaw
in
hectors
wrath
cressida
what
was
his
cause
of
anger
alexander
the
noise
goes
this
there
is
among
the

alexander
this

robbd
many
beasts

particular
additions
he
is
as
valiant
as
a
lion
churlish
as
the
bear
slow
as
the
elephanta
man
into
whom
nature
hath
so
crowded
humours
that
his
valour
is
crushd
into
folly
his
folly
sauced
with
discretion
there
is
no
man
hath
a
virtue
that
he
hath
not
a
glimpse
of
nor
any
man
an
attaint
but
he
carries
some
stain
of
it
he
is
melancholy
without
cause
and
merry
against
the
hair
he
hath
the
joints
of
every
thing
but
everything
so
out
of
joint
that
he
is
a
gouty
briareus
many
hands
and
no
use
or
purblind
argus
all
eyes
and
no
sight
cressida

how

make
hector
angry
alexander

others

tot

his
wit
this
year

he
shall
not
need

if
he
have
his
own
pandarus
nor
his
qualities
cressida
no
matter
pandarus
nor
his
beauty
cressida
twould
not
become
him
his
owns
better
pandarus
you
have
no
judgment
niece
helen
herself
swore
th
other
day
that
troilus
for
a
brown
favour
for
so
tis
i
must
confess
not
brown
neither
cressida
no
but
brown
pandarus
faith
to
say
truth
brown
and
not
brown
cressida
to
say
the
truth
true
and
not
true
pandarus
she
praisd
his
complexion
above
paris
cressida
why
paris
hath
colour
enough
pandarus
so
he
has
cressida
then
troilus
should
have
too
much
if
she
praisd
him
above
his
complexion
is
higher
than
his
he
having
colour
enough
and
the
other
higher
is
too
flaming
praise
for
a
good
complexion
i
had
as
lief
helens
golden
tongue
had
commended
troilus
for
a
copper
nose
pandarus
i
swear
to
you
i
think
helen
loves
him
better
than
paris
cressida
then
shes
a
merry
greek
indeed
pandarus
nay
i
am
sure
she
does
she
came
to
him
th
other
day
into
the
compassd
windowand
you
know
he
has
not
past
three
or
four
hairs
on
his
chin
cressida
indeed
a
tapsters
arithmetic
may
soon
bring
his
particulars
therein
to
a
total
pandarus
why
he
is
very
young
and
yet
will
he
within
three
pound
lift
as
much
as
his
brother
hector
cressida
is
he
so
young
a
man
and
so
old
a
lifter
pandarus
but
to
prove
to
you
that
helen
loves
him
she
came
and
puts
me
her
white
hand
to
his
cloven
chin
cressida
juno
have
mercy
how
came
it
cloven
pandarus
why
you
know
tis
dimpled
i
think
his
smiling
becomes
him
better
than
any
man
in
all
phrygia
cressida
o
he
smiles
valiantly
pandarus
does
he
not
cressida
o
yes
an
twere
a
cloud
in
autumn
pandarus
why
go
to
then
but
to
prove
to
you
that
helen
loves
troilus
cressida
troilus
will
stand
to
the
proof
if
youll
prove
it
so
pandarus
troilus
why
he
esteems
her
no
more
than
i
esteem
an
addle
egg
cressida
if
you
love
an
addle
egg
as
well
as
you
love
an
idle
head
you
would
eat
chickens
i
th
shell
pandarus
i
cannot
choose
but
laugh
to
think
how
she
tickled
his
chin
indeed
she
has
a
marvells
white
hand
i
must
needs
confess
cressida
without
the
rack
pandarus
and
she
takes
upon
her
to
spy
a
white
hair
on
his
chin
cressida
alas
poor
chin
many
a
wart
is
richer
pandarus
but
there
was
such
laughing
queen
hecuba
laughd
that
her
eyes
ran
oer
cressida
with
millstones
pandarus
and
cassandra
laughd
cressida
but
there
was
a
more
temperate
fire
under
the
pot
of
her
eyes
did
her
eyes
run
oer
too
pandarus
and
hector
laughd
cressida
at
what
was
all
this
laughing
pandarus
marry
at
the
white
hair
that
helen
spied
on
troilus
chin
cressida
ant
had
been
a
green
hair
i
should
have
laughd
too
pandarus
they
laughd
not
so
much
at
the
hair
as
at
his
pretty
answer
cressida
what
was
his
answer
pandarus
quoth
she
heres
but
two
and
fifty
hairs
on
your
chin
and
one
of
them
is
white
cressida
this
is
her
question
pandarus
thats
true
make
no
question
of
that
two
and
fifty
hairs
quoth
he
and
one
white
that
white
hair
is
my
father
and
all
the
rest
are
his
sons
jupiter
quoth
she
which
of
these
hairs
is
paris
my
husband
the
forked
one
quoth
he
pluckt
out
and
give
it
him
but

blushd
and

chafd
and

accord
nothing
so
full
of

be
one
among

that
holds
his
honour
higher
than
his
ease
that
seeks
his
praise
more
than
he
fears
his
peril
that
knows
his
valour
and
knows
not
his
fear
that
loves
his
mistress
more
than
in
confession
with
truant
vows

loves

avow

a
grecian
that
is

hector

honour
him
if
none
hell
say
in
troy
when

our
lovers

aeneas
if
none
of

may
that
soldier
a
mere
recreant
prove
that

in

lord
aeneas
let

touch
your
hand
to
our
pavilion
shall
i
lead
you
first
achilles
shall
have
word
of
this
intent
so
shall
each
lord
of

from

shall
feast
with
us
before
you
go

the
welcome
of

exeunt

but
ulysses
and
nestor
ulysses
nestor
nestor
what
says
ulysses
ulysses
i
have
a
young
conception
in
my
brain
be
you
my
time
to
bring
it
to
some
shape
nestor
what
ist
ulysses
this
tis
blunt
wedges
rive
hard
knots
the
seeded
pride
that
hath
to
this
maturity
blown
up
in
rank
achilles
must
or
now
be
croppd
or
shedding
breed
a
nursery
of
like
evil
to
overbulk
us
all
nestor
well
and
how
ulysses
this
challenge
that
the
gallant
hector
sends
however
it
is
spread
in
general
name
relates
in
purpose
only
to
achilles
nestor
true
the
purpose
is
perspicuous
even
as
substance
whose
grossness
little
characters
sum
up
and
in
the
publication
make
no
strain
but
that
achilles
were
his
brain
as
barren
as
banks
of
libyathough
apollo
knows
tis
dry
enoughwill
with
great
speed
of
judgment
ay
with
celerity
find
hectors
purpose
pointing
on
him
ulysses
and
wake
him
to
the
answer
think
you
nestor
why
tis
most
meet
who
may
you
else
oppose
that
can
from
hector
bring
those
honours
off
if
not
achilles
though
t
be
a
sportful
combat
yet
in
this
trial
much
opinion
dwells
for
here
the
troyans
taste
our
dearst
repute
with
their
finst
palate
and
trust
to
me
ulysses
our
imputation
shall
be
oddly
poisd
in
this
vile
action
for
the
success
although
particular
shall
give
a
scantling
of
good
or
bad
unto
the
general
and
in
such
indexes
although
small
pricks
to
their
subsequent
volumes
there
is
seen
the
baby
figure
of
the
giant
mas
of
things
to
come
at
large
it
is
supposd
he
that
meets
hector
issues
from
our
choice
and
choice
being
mutual
act
of
all
our
souls
makes
merit
her
election
and
doth
boil
as
twere
from
forth
us
all
a
man
distilld
out
of
our
virtues
who
miscarrying
what
heart
receives
from
hence
a
conquering
part
to
steel
a
strong
opinion
to
themselves
which
entertaind
limbs
are
his
instruments
in
no
less
working
than
are
swords
and
bows
directive
by
the
limbs
ulysses
give
pardon
to
my
speech
therefore
tis
meet
achilles
meet
not
hector
let
us
like
merchants
show
our
foulest
wares
and
think
perchance
theyll
sell
if
not
the
lustre
of
the
better
yet
to
show
shall
show
the
better
by
showing
the
worst
first
do
not
consent
that
ever
hector
and
achilles
meet
for
both
our
honour
and
our
shame
in
this
are
doggd
with
two
strange
followers
nestor
i
see
them
not
with
my
old
eyes
what
are
they
ulysses
what
glory
our
achilles
shares
from
hector
were
he
not
proud
we
all
should
wear
with
him
but
he
already
is
too
insolent
and
it
were
better
parch
in
afric
sun
than
in
the
pride
and
salt
scorn
of
his
eyes
should
he
scape
hector
fair
if
he
were
foild
why
then
we
do
our
main
opinion
crush
in
taint
of
our
best
man
no
make
a
lottry
and
by
device
let
blockish
ajax
draw
the
sort
to
fight
with
hector
among
ourselves
give
him
allowance
for
the
better
man
for
that
will
physic
the
great
myrmidon
who
broils
in
loud
applause
and
make
him
fall
his
crest
that
prouder
than
blue
iris
bends
if
the
dull
brainless
ajax
come
safe
off
well
dress
him
up
in
voices
if
he
fail
yet
go
we
under
our
opinion
still
that
we
have
better
men
but
hit
or
miss
our
projects
life
this
shape
of
sense
assumes
ajax
employd
plucks
down

plumes
nestor
now
ulysses
i
begin
to
relish
thy
advice
and
i
will
give
a
taste
thereof
forthwith
to
agamemnon
go
we
to
him
straight
two
curs
shall
tame

exit
hector
now
youthful
troilus
do
not
these
high
strains
of
divination
in
our

work
some
touches
of
remorse
or
is
your
blood
so
madly
hot
that
no
discourse
of
reason
nor
fear
of
bad
success
in
a
bad
cause
can
qualify
the
same
troilus
why
brother
hector
we
may
not
think
the
justness
of
each
act
such
and
no
other
than
event
doth
form
it
nor
once
deject
the
courage
of
our
minds
because
cassandras
mad
her
brainsick
raptures
cannot
distaste
the
goodness
of
a
quarrel
which
hath
our
several
honours
all
engagd
to
make
it
gracious
for
my
private
part
i
am
no
more
touchd
than
all
priams
sons
and
jove
forbid
there
should
be
done
amongst
us
such
things
as
might
offend
the
weakest
spleen
to
fight
for
and
maintain
paris
else
might
the
world
convince
of
levity
as
well
my
undertakings
as
your
counsels
but
i
attest
the
gods
your
full
consent
gave
wings
to
my
propension
and
cut
of
all
fears
attending
on
so
dire
a
project
for
what
alas
can
these
my
single
arms
what
propugnation
is
in
one
mans
valour
to
stand
the
push
and
enmity
of
those
this

would
excite
yet
i
protest
were
i
alone
to
pass
the
difficulties
and
had
as
ample
power
as
i
have
will
paris
should
neer
retract
what
he
hath
done
nor
faint
in
the
pursuit
priam
paris
you
speak
like
one
besotted
on
your
sweet
delights
you
have
the
honey
still
but
these
the
gall
so
to
be
valiant
is
no
praise
at
all
paris
sir
i
propose
not
merely
to
myself
the
pleasures
such
a
beauty
brings
with
it
but
i
would
have
the
soil
of
her
fair
rape
wipd
off
in
honourable
keeping
her
what
treason
were
it
to
the
ransackd
queen
disgrace
to
your
great
worths
and
shame
to
me
now
to
deliver
her
possession
up
on
terms
of
base
compulsion
can
it
be
that
so
degenerate
a
strain
as
this
should
once
set
footing
in
your
generous
bosoms
theres
not
the
meanest
spirit
on
our
party
without
a
heart
to
dare
or
sword
to
draw
when
helen
is
defended
nor
none
so
noble
whose
life
were
ill
bestowd
or
death
unfamd
where
helen
is
the
subject
then
i
say
well
may
we
fight
for
her
whom
we
know
well
the
worlds
large
spaces
cannot
parallel
hector
paris
and
troilus
you
have
both
said
well
and
on
the
cause
and
question
now
in
hand
have
glozd
but
superficially
not
much
unlike
young
men
whom
aristode
thought
unfit
to
hear
moral
philosophy
the
reasons
you
allege
do
more
conduce
to
the
hot
passion
of
distempred
blood
than
to
make
up
a
free
determination
twixt
right
and
wrong
for
pleasure
and
revenge
have
ears
more
deaf
than
adders
to
the
voice
of
any
true

nature
craves
all
dues
be
rendred
to
their
owners
now
what
nearer
debt
in
all
humanity
than
wife
is
to
the
husband
if
this
law
of
nature
be
corrupted
through
affection
and
that
great
minds
of
partial
indulgence
to
their
benumbed
wills
resist
the
same
there
is
a
law
in
each
wellorderd
nation
to
curb
those
raging
appetites
that
are
most
disobedient
and
refractory
if
helen
then
be
wife
to
spartas
king
as
it
is
known
she
isthese
moral
laws
of
nature
and
of
nations
speak
aloud
to
have
her
back
returnd
thus
to
persist
in
doing
wrong
extenuates
not
wrong
but
makes
it
much
more
heavy
hectors
opinion
is
this
in
way
of
truth
yet
neer
the
less
my
spritely
brethren
i
propend
to
you
in
resolution
to
keep
helen
still
for
tis
a
cause
that
hath
no
mean
dependence
upon
our
joint
and
several
dignities
troilus
why
there
you
touchd
the
life
of
our
design
were
it
not
glory
that
we
more
affected
than
the
performance
of
our
heaving
spleens
i
would
not
wish
a
drop
of
troyan
blood
spent
more
in
her
defence
but
worthy
hector
she
is
a
theme
of
honour
and
renown
a
spur
to
valiant
and
magnanimous
deeds
whose
present
courage
may
beat
down
our
foes
and
fame
in
time
to
come
canonize
us
for
i
presume
brave
hector
would
not
lose
so
rich
advantage
of
a
promisd
glory
as
smiles
upon
the
forehead
of
this
action
for
the
wide

revenue
hector
i
am
yours
you
valiant
offspring
of
great
priamus
i
have
a
roisting
challenge
sent
amongst
the
dull
and
factious
nobles
of
the
greeks
will
strike
amazement
to
their
drowsy
spirits

his

wingd
thus
swift
with

cannot
outfly
our
apprehensions
much
attribute
he
hath
and
much
the
reason
why
we
ascribe
it
to
him
yet
all
his
virtues
not
virtuously
on
his
own
part
beheld
do
in
our
eyes
begin
to
lose
their
gloss
yea
like
fair
fruit
in

untasted
go
and
tell
him
we
come

and
you
shall
not
sin
if
you
do

we

him
overproud

underhonest
in
selfassumption
greater
than
in
the
note
of
judgment
and
worthier
than
himself
here
tend
the
savage
strangeness
he
puts
on
disguise
the
holy
strength
of
their
command
and
underwrite
in
an
observing
kind
his
humorous
predominance
yea
watch
his

his

his
flows
as
if
the

of

rode
on

go
tell
him
this

that
if

well
none

rages

so
plaguy
proud
that

bastes
his
arrogance
with

grant
what
makes
this
pretty
abruption
what
too
curious
dreg
espies
my
sweet
lady
in
the
fountain
of
our
love
cressida
more
dregs
than
water
if
my
fears
have
eyes
troilus
fears
make
devils
of
cherubims
they
never
see
truly
cressida
blind
fear
that
seeing
reason
leads
finds
safer
footing
than
blind
reason
stumbling
without
fear
to
fear
the
worst
oft
cures
the
worse
troilus
o
let
my
lady
apprehend
no
fear
in
all
cupids
pageant
there
is
presented
no
monster
cressida
nor
nothing
monstrous
neither
troilus
nothing
but
our
undertakings
when
we
vow
to
weep
seas
live
in
fire
cat
rocks
tame
tigers
thinking
it
harder
for
our
mistress
to
devise
imposition
enough
than
for
us
to
undergo
any
difficulty
imposed
this
is
the
monstruosity
in
love
lady
that
the
will
is
infinite
and
the
execution
confind
that
the
desire
is
boundless
and
the
act
a
slave
to
limit
cressida
they
say
all
lovers
swear
more
performance
than
they
are
able
and
yet
reserve
an
ability
that
they
never
perform
vowing
more
than
the
perfection
of
ten
and
discharging
less
than
the
tenth
part
of
one
they
that
have
the
voice
of
lions
and
the
act
of
hares
are
they
not
monsters

we
praise
us

crown
it
no
perfection
in

in

desert
before
his

and
being
born
his

shall
be
humble
few
words
to
fair
faith
troilus
shall
be
such
to
cressid
as
what
envy
can
say
worst
shall
be
a
mock
for
his

prince
troilus
i
have
lovd
you
night

for
many
weary
months
troilus
why
was
my
cressid
then
so
hard
to
win
cressida
hard
to
seem
won
but
i
was
won
my
lord
with
the
first
glance
that
everpardon
me
if
i
confess
much
you
will
play
the
tyrant
i
love
you
now
but
till
now
not
so
much
but
i
might
master
it
in
faith
i
lie
my
thoughts
were
like
unbridled
children
grown
too
headstrong
for
their
mother
see
we
fools
why
have
i
blabbd
who
shall
be
true
to
us
when
we
are
so
unsecret
to
ourselves
but
though
i
lovd
you
well
i
wood
you
not
and
yet
good
faith
i
wishd
myself
a
man
or
that
we
women
had
mens
privilege
of
speaking
first
sweet
bid
me
hold
my
tongue
for
in
this
rapture
i
shall
surely
speak
the
thing
i
shall
repent
see
see
your
silence
cunning
in
dumbness
from
my
weakness
draws
my
very
soul
of
counsel
stop
my
mouth
troilus
and
shall
albeit
sweet
music
issues
thence
pandarus
pretty
i
faith
cressida
my
lord
i
do
beseech
you
pardon
me
twas
not
my
purpose
thus
to
beg
a
kiss
i
am
ashamd
o
heavens
what
have
i
done
for
this
time
will
i
take
my
leave
my
lord
troilus
your
leave
sweet
cressid
pandarus
leave
an
you
take
leave
till
tomorrow
morning
cressida
pray
you
content
you
troilus
what
offends
you
lady
cressida
sir
mine
own
company
troilus
you
cannot
shun
yourself
cressida
let
me
go
and
try
i
have
a
kind
of
self
resides
with
you
but
an
unkind
self
that
itself
will
leave
to
be
anothers
fool
i
would
be
gone
where
is
my
wit
i
know
not
what
i
speak
troilus
well
know
they
what
they
speak
that
speak
so
wisely
cressida
perchance
my
lord
i
show
more
craft
than
love
and
fell
so
roundly
to
a
large
confession
to
angle
for
your
thoughts
but
you
are
wise
or
else
you
love
not
for
to
be
wise
and
love
exceeds
mans
might
that
dwells
with
gods
above
troilus
o
that
i
thought
it
could
be
in
a
woman
as
if
it
can
i
will
presume
in
you
to
feed
for
aye
her
lamp
and
flames
of
love
to
keep
her
constancy
in
plight
and
youth
outliving
beautys
outward
with
a
mind
that
doth
renew
swifter
than
blood
decays
or
that
persuasion
could
but
thus
convince
me
that
my
integrity
and
truth
to
you
might
be
affronted
with
the
match
and
weight
of
such
a
winnowed
purity
in
love
how
were
i
then
uplifted
but
alas
i
am
as
true
as

and
simpler
than
the

and
not

honour
for

that
are
without

as

methinks
find
out
something
not

a
strange
fellow
here
writes
me
that
manhow
dearly
ever
parted
how
much
in
having
or
without
or
in
cannot
make
boast
to
have
that
which
he
hath
nor
feels
not
what
he
owes
but
by
reflection
as
when
his
virtues
shining
upon
others
heat
them
and
they
retort
that
heat
again
to
the
first
giver
achilles
this
is
not
strange
ulysses
the
beauty
that
is
borne
here
in
the
face
the
bearer
knows
not
but
commends
itself
to
others
eyes
nor
doth
the
eye
itself
that
most
pure
spirit
of
sensebehold
itself
not
going
from
itself
but

turns
not
to
itself
till
it
hath
travelld
and
is
mirrord
there
where
it
may
see

this
is
not
strange
at
all
ulysses
i
do
not
strain
at
the
position
it
is
familiarbut
at
the
authors
drift
who
in
his
circumstance
expressly
proves
that
no
man
is
the
lord
of
anything
though
in
and
of
him
there
be
much
consisting
till
he
communicate
his
parts
to
others
nor
doth
he
of
himself

behold

formed

not
the

thy

glorious
deeds
but
in

made
emulous

mongst
the

themselves
and
drave
great

to

achilles
of
this
my
privacy
i
have
strong
reasons
ulysses

gainst
your

the
reasons
are
more
potent
and
heroical
tis

achilles
that
you
are
in

is
that
a

the

knows
almost
every
grain
of
plutus
gold
finds
bottom
in
th
uncomprehensive

almost
like

unveil
in

cradles
there
is
a
mysterywith

relation
durst
never

the

which
hath
an
operation
more
divine
than

to
all
the
commerce
that
you
have
had
with
troy
as
perfectly
is
ours
as
yours
my
lord
and
better
would
it
fit
achilles
much
to
throw
down
hector
than
polyxena
but
it
must
grieve
young
pyrrhus
now
at
home
when
fame
shall
in
our
island
sound
her
trump
and
all
the
greekish
girls
shall
tripping
sing
great
hectors
sister

achilles
win
but
our
great
ajax
bravely
beat
down

farewell
my

you
a

impudent
and
mannish
grown
is
not
more
loathd
than
an
effeminate
man
in
time
of
action
i
stand
condemnd
for
this
they
think
my
little
stomach
to
the
war
and
your
great
love
to
me
restrains
you
thus
sweet
rouse
yourself
and
the
weak
wanton
cupid
shall
from
your
neck
unloose
his
amorous
fold
and
like
a
dewdrop
from
the
lions
mane
be
shook
to
airy
air
achilles
shall
ajax
fight
with
hector
patroclus
ay
and
perhaps
receive
much
honour
by
him
achilles
i
see
my
reputation
is
at

my
fame
is
shrewdly
gord
patroclus
o
then
beware
those
wounds

ill
that
men
do
give
themselves
omission
to
do
what
is
necessary
seals
a
commission
to
a
blank
of
danger
and
danger
like

hither
sweet
patroclus
ill

the
fool
to

desire
him
t

lords
after
the
combat
to
see
us
here
unarmd
i
have
a
womans
longing
an
appetite
that
i
am
sick
withal
to
see
great
hector
in
his
weeds
of
peace
to
talk
with
him
and
to
behold
his
visage
even
to
my
full
of
view

enter
thersites

a
labour
savd
thersites
a
wonder
achilles
what
thersites
ajax
goes
up
and
down
the
field
asking
for
himself
achilles
how
so
thersites
he
must
fight
singly
tomorrow
with
hector
and
is
so
prophetically
proud
of
an
heroical
cudgelling
that
he
raves
in
saying
nothing
achilles
how
can
that
be
thersites
why
a
stalks
up
and
down
like
a
peacocka
stride
and
a
stand
ruminaies
like
an
hostess
that
hath
no
arithmetic
but
her
brain
to
set
down
her
reckoning
bites
his
lip
with
a
politic
regard
as
who
should
say
there
were
wit
in
this
head
an
twould
out
and
so
there
is
but
it
lies
as
coldly
in
him
as
fire
in
a
flint
which
will
not
show
without
knocking
the
mans
undone
for
ever
for
if
hector
break
not
his
neck
i
th
combat
hell
breakt
himself
in
vainglory
he
knows
not
me
i
said

flowing

with

how

may
move
and

alas
a
kind
of
godly
jealousy
which
i

you
call
a
virtuous
sin
makes
me
afeard
cressida
o

you
love
me

troilus

i
a

then
in

thou
gallant
troyan
seen
thee
oft
labouring
for
destiny
make
cruel
way
through
ranks
of
greekish
youth
and
i
have
seen
thee
as
hot
as
perseus
spur
thy
phrygian
steed
despising
many
forfeits
and
subduements
when
thou
hast
hung
thy
advanced
sword
i
th
air
not
letting
it
decline
on
the
declined
that
i
have
said
to
some
my
standersby
lo
jupiter
is
yonder
dealing
life
and
i
have
seen
thee
pause
and
take
thy
breath
when
that
a
ring
of
greeks
have
hemmd
thee
in
like
an
olympian
wrestling
this
have
i
seen
but
this
thy
countenance
still
lockd
in
steel
i
never
saw
till
now
i
knew
thy
grandsire
and
once
fought
with
him
he
was
a
soldier
good
but
by
great
mars
the
captain
of
us
all
never
like
thee
o
let
an
old
man
embrace
thee
and
worthy
warrior
welcome
to
our
tents
aeneas

the
old
nestor

thee
good
old

so
long
walkd
hand

hand
with
time
most
reverend
nestor

am
glad
to
clasp
thee
nestor
i
would
my

in
contention
as

would
they
could

ha
by

time
ulysses

her
base
and
pillar
by
us
hector
i
know
your
favour
lord
ulysses
well
ah

theres
many
a
greek
and

on
your
greekish
embassy
ulysses
sir
i
foretold
you
then
what
would
ensue
my
prophecy
is
but
half
his
journey
yet
for
yonder
walls
that
pertly
front
your
town
yond
towers
whose
wanton
tops
do
buss
the
clouds
must
kiss
their
own
feet
hector
i
must
not
believe
you
there
they
stand
yet
and
modestly
i
think
the
fall
of
every
phrygian
stone
will
cost
a
drop
of
grecian
blood
the
end
crowns
all
and
that
old
common
arbitrator
time
will
one
day
end
it
ulysses
so
to
him
we
leave
it
most
gentle
and
most
valiant
hector
welcome
after
the
general
i
beseech
you

this
is
my
ladys
hand
these
be
her
very
cs
her
us
and
her
ts
and
thus
makes
she
her
great
ps
it
is
in
contempt
of
question
her
hand
aguecheek
her
cs
her
us
and
her
ts
why
that
malvolio
reads
to
the
unknown
belovd
this
and
my
good

very
phrases
by

wax
soft
and
the

with
which
she
uses
to
seal
tis
my

to
whom
should
this
be
fabian
this
wins
him
liver
and
all
malvolio
reads

jove
knows
i
love
but
who
lips
do
not
move
no
man
must
know

no

must
know
what
follows
the
numbers
alterd
no
man
must
know
if
this
should
be
thee
malvolio
sir
toby
marry
hang
thee
brock
malvolio
reads

i
may
command
where
i
adore
but
silence
like
a
lucrece
knife
with
bloodless
stroke
my
heart
doth
gore
m
o
a
i
doth
sway
my
life

fabian
a
fustian
riddle
sir
toby
excellent
wench
say
i
malvolio
m
o
a
i
doth
sway
my
life
nay
but
first
let
me
see
let
me
see
let
me
see
fabian
what
dish
o
poison
has
she
dressd
him
sir
toby
and
with
what
wing
the
staniel
checks
at
it
malvolio
i
may
command
where
i
adore
why
she
may
command
me
i
serve
her
she
is
my
lady
why
this
is
evident
to
any
formal
capacity
there
is
no
obstruction
in
this
and
the
end
what
should
that
alphabetical
position
portend
if
i
could
make
that
resemble
something
in
me
softly
m
o
a
i
sir
toby
o
ay
make
up
that
he
is
now
at
a
cold
scent
fabian
sowter
will
cry
upont
for
all
this
though
it
be
as
rank
as
a
fox
malvolio
m
malvolio
m
why
that
begins
my
name
fabian
did
not
i
say
he
would
work
it
out
the
cur
is
excellent
at
faults
malvolio
m
but
then
there
is
no
consonancy
in
the
sequel
that
suffers
under
probation
a
should
follow
but
o
does
fabian
and
o
shall
end
i
hope
sir
toby
ay
or
ill
cudgel
him
and
make
him
cry
o
malvolio
and
then
i
comes
behind
fabian
ay
an
you
had
any
eye
behind
you
you
might
see
more
detraction
at
your
heels
than

did
commend

of

did
praise
my
leg
being
crossgarterd

in

she
manifests
herself
to

a
kind
of
injunction
drives

to

i
either
sir

him
he
must
run
mad
maria

does
it
work
upon
him

the
fruits
of
the

approach
before

will
come
to
her
in
yellow
stockings
and

a
colour
she
abhors
and
crossgarterd
a
fashion
she
detests
and
he
will
smile
upon
her
which
will
now
be
so
unsuitable
to
her
disposition
being
addicted
to
a
melancholy
as
she
is
that
it
cannot
but
turn
him
into
a
notable
contempt

like
the
haggard

as
full
of
labour
as
a
wise

wisely
shows
is
fit

thinkst
of
me
viola
that
you
do
think
you
are
not
what
you
are
olivia
if
i
think
so
i
think
the
same
of
you
viola
then
think
you
right
i
am
not
what
i
am
olivia
i
would
you
were
as
i
would
have
you
be
viola
would
it
be
better
madam
than
i
am
i
wish
it
might
for
now
i
am
your
fool
olivia
o
what
a
deal
of
scorn
looks
beautiful
in
the
contempt
and
anger
of
his
lip
a
murdrous
guilt
shows
not
itself
more
soon
than
love
that
would
seem
hid
loves
night
is
noon
cesario
by
the
roses
of
the
spring
by
maidhood
honour
truth
and
every
thing
i
love
thee
so
that
maugre
all
thy
pride
nor
wit
nor
reason
can
my
passion
hide
do
not
extort
thy
reasons
from
this
clause
for
that
i
woo
thou
therefore
hast
no
cause
but
rather
reason
thus
with
reason
fetter
love
sought
is
good
but
given
unsought
is
better
viola
by
innocence
i
swear
and
by
my
youth
i
have
one
heart
one
bosom
and
one
truth
and
that
no
woman
has
nor
never
none
shall
mistress
be
of
it
save
i
alone
and
so
adieu
good
madam
never
more
will
i
my
masters
tears
to
you
deplore
olivia
yet
come
again
for
thou
perhaps
mayst
move
that
heart
which
now
abhors
to
like
his
love

the
while
old

make
an
ass
o
me
fabian
i
will
prove
it
legitimate
sir
upon
the
oaths
of
judgment
and

sir
toby
and
they

been
grandjurymen
since
before
noah
was
a
sailor
fabian
she
did
show
favour
to
the
youth
in
your
sight
only
to
exasperate
you
to
awake
your
dormouse
valour
to
put
fire
in
your
heart
and
brimstone
in
your
liver
you
should
then
have
accosted
her
and
with
some
excellent
jests
firenew
from
the
mint
you
should
have
bangd
the
youth
into
dumbness
this
was
lookd
for
at
your
hand
and
this
was
baulkd
the
double
gilt
of
this
opportunity
you
let
time
wash
off
and
you
are
now
saild
into
the
north
of
my
ladys
opinion
where
you
will
hang

an
icicle
on
dutchmans
beard
unless
you
do
redeem
it
by
some
laudable
attempt
either
of
valour
or
policy
aguecheek

places
my
niece
shall
take
note
of
it
and
assure
thyself
there
is
no
lovebroker
in
the
world
can
more
prevail
in
mans
commendation
with
woman
than
report
of
valour
fabian
there
is
no
way
but
this
sir
andrew
aguecheek
will
either
of
you
bear
me
a
challenge
to
him
sir
toby
go
write
it
in
a
martial
hand
be
curst
and
brief
it
is
no
matter
how
witty
so
it
be
eloquent
and
full
of
invention
taunt
him
with
the
license
of
ink
if
thou
thoust
him
some
thrice
it
shall
not
be
amiss
and
as
many
lies
as

although
the
sheet
were
big
enough
for
the

of

in
england
set
em
down
go
about
it
let
there
be

enough
in

though
so
much
as

have
drawn
one
to
a

jealousy
what

skilless
in

to
a

if
this
letter
move
him
not
his

cannot
ill
givet
him
maria
you
may
have
very
fit
occasion
fort
he

by
depart
sir
toby
go
sir
andrew
scout
me
for
him
at
the
corner
of
the
orchard
like
a
bumbaily
so
soon
as
ever
thou
seest
him
draw
and
as
thou
drawst
swear
horrible
for
it
comes
to
pass
oft
that
a
terrible
oath
with
a
swaggering
accent
sharply
twangd
off
gives
manhood
more
approbation
than
ever
proof
itself
would
have
earnd
him
away
aguecheek

me
alone
for
swearing















exit
sir

him
out
to

of
good
capacity
and
breeding
his
employment
between
his
lord
and
my
niece
confirms
no
less
therefore
this
letter

breed
no
terror
in

find
it
comes
from
a
clodpole
but
sir

will
deliver
his
challenge
by
word
of
mouth
set
upon
aguecheek
notable
report
of
valour
and
drive
the
gentleman
as
know
his
youth
will
aptly
receive
it
into
a
most
hideous
opinion
of
his
rage
skill
fury
and
impetuosity
this
will
so
fright
them
both
that
they
will
kill
one
another
by
the
look
like
cockatrices

glorious

tis
not
madness
wheres
antonio
then
i
could
not
find
him
at
the
elephant
yet
there
he
was
and
there
i
found
this
credit
that
he
did
range
the
town
to
seek
me
out
his
counsel
now
might
do
me
golden
service
for
though
my
soul
disputes
well
with
my
sense
that
this
may
be
some
error
but
no
madness
yet
doth
this
accident
and
flood
of
fortune
so
far
exceed
all
instance
all
discourse
that
i
am
ready
to
distrust
mine
eyes
and
wrangle
with
my
reason
that
persuades
me
to
any
other
trust

that
i

mad

with
such
a
smooth
discreet
and
stable

black
as
vulcan
in
the
smoke
of

a
baubling
vessel
was
he
captain
of
for
shallow
draught
and
bulk
unprizable
with
which
such
scathful
grapple
did
he
make
with
the
most
noble
bottom
of
our
fleet
that
very
envy
and
the
tongue
of
los
cried
fame
and
honour
on
him
whats
the
matter
first
officer
orsino

is
that
antonio
that
took
the
phoenix
and
her
fraught
from
candy

this
is
he
that
did
the
tiger
board
when
your
young
nephew
titus
lost
his
leg

of
shame

the
danger
of
this
adverse

to
defend
him
when
he
was
beset
where
being
apprehended
his
false
cunning
not
meaning
to
partake
with
me
in
danger
taught
him
to
face
me
out
of
his
acquaintance
and
grew
a
twenty
years
removed
thing
while
one
would
wink
denied
me

olivia
most
wonderful
sebastian

i
stand
there
i
never

a

nor
can
there
be
that
deity
in
my
nature
of
here
and
everywhere
i
had
a
sister
whom
the
blind
waves
and
surges
have
devourd
of
charity
what
kin
are
you
to
me
what
countryman
what
name
what
parentage
viola
of
messaline
sebastian
was
my
father
such
a
sebastian
was
my
brother
too
so
went
he
suited
to
his
watery
tomb
if
spirits
can
assume
both
form
and
suit
you
come
to
fright
us
sebastian
a
spirit
i
am
indeed
but
am
in
that
dimension
grossly
clad
which
from
the
womb
i
did
participate
were
you
a
woman
as
the
rest
goes
even
i
should
my
tears
let
fall
upon
your
cheek
and
say
thrice
welcome
drowned
viola
viola
my
father
had
a
mole
upon
his
brow
sebastian
and
so
had
mine
viola
and
died
that
day
when
viola
from
her
birth
had
numbred
thirteen
years
sebastian
o
that
record
is
lively
in
my
soul
he
finished
indeed
his
mortal
act
that
day
that
made
my
sister
thirteen
years
viola
if
nothing
lets
to
make
us
happy
both
but
this
my
masculine
usurpd
attire

not
embrace
me
till
each
circumstance
of
place
time
fortune
do
cohere
and
jump
that
i
am
viola

to
confirm
ill

said
to

a
thousand
times

i
malvolio
no
malvolio
lady
you
have
pray
you
peruse
that
letter
you
must
not
now
deny
it
is
your
hand
write
from
it
if
you
can
in
hand
or
phrase
or
say
tis
not
your
seal
not
your
invention
you
can
say
none
of
this
well
grant
it
then
and
tell
me
in
the
modesty
of
honour
why
you
have
given
me
such
clear
lights
of
favour
bade
me
come
smiling
and
crossgarterd
to
you
to
put
on
yellow
stockings
and
to
frown
upon
sir
toby
and
the
lighter
people
and
acting
this
in
an
obedient
hope
why
have
you
sufferd
me
to
be
imprisond
kept
in
a
dark
house
visited
by
the
priest
and
made
the
most
notorious
geck
and
gul
that
eer
invention
playd
on
tell
me
why
olivia
alas
malvolio
this
is
not
my
writing
though
i
confess
much
like
the
character
but
out
of
question
tis
marias
hand
and
now
i
do
bethink
me
it
was
she
first
told
me
thou
wast
mad
then
camst
in
smiling
and
in
such
forms
which
here
were
presupposd
upon
thee
in
the
letter
prithee
be
content
this
practice
hath
most
shrewdly
passd
upon
thee
but
when
we
know
the
grounds
and
authors
of
it
thou
shalt
be
both
the
plaintiff
and
the
judge
of
thine
own
cause
fabian
good
madam
hear
me
speak
and
let
no
quarrel
nor
no
brawl
to
come
taint
the
condition
of
this
present
hour
which
i
have
wondred
at
in
hope
it
shall
not
most
freely
i
confess
myself
and
toby
set
this
device
against
malvolio
here
upon
some
stubborn
and
uncourteous
parts
we
had
conceivd
against
him
maria
writ
the
letter
at
sir
tobys
great
importance
in
recompense
whereof
he
hath
married
her
how
with
a
sportful
malice
it
was
followd
may
rather
pluck
on
laughter
than
revenge
if
that
the
injuries
be
justly
weighd
that
have
on
both
sides
passd
olivia
alas
poor
fool
how
have
they
baffld
thee
clown
why
some
are
born
great
some
achieve
greatness
and
some
have
greatness
thrown
upon
them
i
was
one
sir
in
this
interlude
one
sir
topas
sir
but
thats
all
one
by
the
lord
fool

am
not
mad
but
do
you
remember
madam
why
laugh
you
at
such
a
barren
rascal
an
you
smile
not
hes
gaggd
and
thus
the
whirligig
of
time
brings
in
his
revenges
malvolio
ill
be
revengd
on
the
whole
pack
of
you
exit
olivia
he
hath
been
most
notoriously
abusd
duke
pursue
him
and
entreat
him
to
a
peace
he
hath
not

when

and
golden
time

a
solemn
combination

great
while

love
for
he
was
more
than
over
shoes
in
love
valentine
tis
true
for
you
are
over
boots
in

and
yet
you
never

no
i
will
not
for
it

valentine
to

bought
with
groans
coy
looks
with

sighs
one
fading
moments
mirth
with
twenty
watchful
weary
tedious
nights
if
haply
won
perhaps
a
hapless
gain
if
lost
why
then
a
grievous
labour
won
however
but
a
folly
bought
with
wit
or
else
a
wit
by
folly
vanquished
proteus
so
by
your
circumstance
you
call
me
fool
valentine
so
by
your
circumstance
i
fear
youll
prove
proteus
tis

not
love
valentine
love
is
your
master
for
he
masters
you
and
he
that
is
so
yoked
by
a
fool
methinks
should
not
be
chronicled
for
wise
proteus
yet
writers
say
as
in
the
sweetest
bud
the
eating
canker
dwells
so
eating
love
inhabits
in
the
finest
wits
of
all
valentine
and
writers
say
as
the
most
forward
bud
is
eaten
by
the
canker
ere
it
blow
even
so
by
love
the
young
and
tender
wit
is
turnd
to
folly
blasting
in
the
bud
losing
his
verdure
even
in
the
prime
and
all
the
fair
effects
of
future
hopes
but
wherefore
waste
i
time
to
counsel
the
that
art
a
votary
to
fond
desire
once
more
adieu
my
father
at
the
road

at

made

enter
speed

speed
sir
proteus
save
you
saw
you
my
master
proteus
but
now
he
parted
hence
to
embark
for
milan
speed
twenty
to
one
then
he
is
shippd
already
and
i
have
playd
the
sheep
in
losing
him
proteus
indeed
a
sheep
doth
very
often
stray
an
if
the
shepherd
be
awhile
away
speed
you
conclude
that
my
master
is
a
shepherd
then
and
i
a
sheep
proteus
i
do
speed
why
then
my
horns
are
his
horns
whether
i
wake
or
sleep
proteus
a
silly
answer
and
fitting
well
a
sheep
speed
this
proves
me
still
a
sheep
proteus
true
and
thy
master
a
shepherd
speed
nay
that
i
can
deny
by
a
circumstance
proteus
it
shall
go
hard
but
ill
prove
it
by
another
speed
the
shepherd
seeks
the
sheep
and
not
the
sheep
the
shepherd
but
i
seek
my
master
and
my
master
seeks
not
me
therefore
i
am
no
sheep
proteus
the
sheep
for
fodder
follow
the
shepherd
the
shepherd
for
food
follows
not
the
sheep
thou
for
wages
followest
thy
master
thy
master
for
wages
follows
not
thee
therefore
thou
art
a
sheep
speed
such
another
proof
will
make
me
cry
baa
proteus
but
dost
thou
hear
gavst
thou

hard
to

i
fear
shell
prove
as

of
a
knight
wellspoken
neat
and
fine
but

what

so
so
julia
what

thou
of

what
folly
reigns
in

julia
how
now
what

passion
at

lucetta
pardon

tis
a
passing
shame
that
i
unworthy
body
as

am
should
censure
thus
on
lovely
gentlemen
julia
why
not
on
proteus
as
of
all
the

lucetta
then
thus
of

good
i
think
him

julia
your
reason
lucetta
i
have
no
other
but
a
womans
reason
i

wouldst
thou
have
me
cast
my
love
on
him
lucetta
ay
if

yet
he
of
all
the
rest
i
think
best
loves
ye
julia
his
little
speaking
shows

burns
most
of
all

receive
it
pardon

harbour
wanton

conspire
against
my

an
office
of
great
worth
and
you
an

take
the
paper
see
it
be
returnd
or
else
return
no
more
into

julia
will
ye
be
gone
lucetta
that
you

ruminate


























exit
julia
and
yet
i
would
i
had
oerlookd
the

a
shame
to
call

and
pray
her
to
a
fault
for
which
i
chid
her
what
fool
is
she
that
knows
i
am
a
maid
and
would
not
force
the
letter
to
my
view
since
maids
in
modesty
say
no
to
that
which
they
would
have
the
profferer
construe
ay
fie
fie
how
wayward
is
this
foolish
love
that
like
a
testy
babe
will
scratch
the
nurse
and
presently
all
humbled
kiss
the
rod
how
churlishly
i
chid
lucetta
hence
when
willingly
i
would
have
had
her
here
how
angerly
i
taught
my
brow
to
frown
when
inward
joy
enforcd
my
heart
to
smile
my
penance
is
to
call
lucetta
back
and
ask
remission
for
my
folly
past
what
ho
lucetta

reenter
lucetta

lucetta
what
would
your

i
would
it
were
that

your
stomach
on
your
meat
and
not
upon
your
maid
julia
what
ist
that
you
took
up
so
gingerly
lucetta

julia
why
didst
thou
stoop
then
lucetta
to
take
a
paper
up
that
i
let
fall
julia
and
is
that
paper
nothing
lucetta
nothing
concerning
me

and
why
not
you
lucetta

how
now
minion

such
sweet
honey
and
kill

as
in
revenge
of
thy
ingratitude
i
throw
thy
name
against
the
bruising
stones
trampling
contemptuously
on
thy
disdain
and
here
is
writ
lovewounded
proteus
poor
wounded

my
bosomas
a
bed
shall
lodge
thee
till
thy
wound
be
throughly
heald

some
whirlwind
bear
unto
a
ragged
fearful
hanging
rock
and
throw
it
thence
into
the
raging
sea

here
in
one
line
is
his
name
twice
writ
poor
forlorn
proteus
passionate
proteus
to
the
sweet
julia
that
ill
tear
away
and
yet
i
will
not
sith

prettily

wellbelovd
and
daily
graced
by

wishing
me

resembleth
the
uncertain
glory
of

one
that

the
pestilence
to
sigh
like
a
schoolboy
that
had
lost
his
a
b

like
a

diet
to

like
one
that
fears

puling
like
a

at

you
were
wont
when

laughed
to
crow
like
a
cock
when

to
walk
like

of
the
lions
when

fasted
it
was
presently
after
dinner
when
you
lookd
sadly
it
was
for
want
of
money
and
now
you
are
metamorphisd
with
a
mistress

they
are
all
perceivd
without
ye
valentine
without

they
cannot
speed
without
you
nay
thats
certain
for
without
you
were
so
simple
none

would
but
you
are
so
without
these
follies
that
these
follies
are
within
you
and
shine
through
you
like
the
water
in
an
urinal
that
not
an
eye
that
sees
you
but
is
a
physician
to
comment
on
your
malady
valentine
but
tell
me
dost
thou
know
my
lady
silvia
speed
she
that
you

as

sits
at

fair
as
of

wellfavourd
valentine
i
mean
that
her
beauty
is
exquisite
but
her

proteus
for
thats
his

made
use
and
fair
advantage
of
his
days
his
years
but
young
but
his
experience
old
his
head
unmellowed
but
his
judgment
ripe

in

for
far
behind
his

all
the

your

in

was
this
the
idol
that
you
worship
so
valentine
even
she
and
is

not
a

proteus
no

she
is
an
earthly
paragon
valentine
call
her
divine
proteus
i

was
sick
you
gave
me
bitter
pills
and
i
must
minister

sweet
except

any
except
thou

except
against

proteus
have
i
not
reason

prefer
mine
own
valentine
and
i
will
help
thee
to
prefer
her
too
she
shall
be
dignified
with
this
high
honour
to
bear
my
ladys
train
lest
the
base
earth
should
from
her
vesture
chance
to
steal
a
kiss
and
of
so
great
a
favour
growing
proud
disdain
to
root
the
summerswelling
flowr
and
make
rough
winter
everlastingly
proteus
why
valentine
what
braggardism
is
this
valentine
pardon
me
proteus
all
i
can
is
nothing
to
her
whose
worth
makes
other
worthies
nothing
she
is
alone
proteus
then
let
her
alone
valentine
not
for
the
world
why
man
she
is
mine
own
and
i
as
rich
in
having
such
a
jewel
as
twenty
seas
if
all
their
sand
were
pearl
the
water
nectar
and
the
rocks
pure
gold
forgive
me
that
i
do
not
dream
on
thee
because
thou
seest
me
dote
upon
my
love
my
foolish
rival
that
her
father
likes
only
for
his
possessions
are
so
huge
is
gone

we

nay
more
our

with
all
the

made
of

and
all

my

good

go
with
me
to
my
chamber
in
these
affairs
to
aid
me
with
thy
counsel
proteus
go
on
before
i
shall
enquire
you
forth
i
must

the
road
to
disembark
some
necessaries
that
i
needs
must
use
and
then
ill
presently
attend
you
valentine
will
you
make

proteus
i
will































exit
valentine
even
as
one
heat
another
heat
expels
or
as
one
nail
by
strength
drives
out
another
so
the
remembrance
of
my
former
love
is
by
a
newer
object
quite
forgotten
is
it
my
mind
or
valentinus
praise
her
true
perfection
or
my
false
transgression
that
makes
me
reasonless
to
reason
thus
she
is
fair
and
so
is
julia
that
i
love
that
i
did
love
for
now
my
love
is
thawd
which
like
a
waxen
image
gainst
a
fire
bears
no
impression
of
the
thing
it
was
methinks
my
zeal
to
valentine
is
cold
and
that
i
love
him
not
as
i
was
wont
o
but
i
love
his
lady
too
too
much
and
thats
the
reason
i
love
him
so
little
how
shall
i
dote
on
her
with
more
advice
that
thus
without
advice
begin
to
love
her
tis
but
her
picture
i
have
yet
beheld
and
that
hath
dazzled
my
reasons
light
but
when
i
look
on
her
perfections
there
is
no
reason
but
i
shall
be
blind
if
i
can
check
my
erring
love
i
will
if
not
to
compass
her
ill
use
my
skill

deceitful
men
julia
base
men
that

so
base
effect
but
truer
stars
did
govern
proteus
birth
his
words
are
bonds
his
oaths
are
oracles
his
love
sincere
his
thoughts
immaculate
his
tears
pure
messengers
sent
from
his
heart
his
heart
as
far
from
fraud
as

thus
be
stoln
away
from

it
would
be
much
vexation
to
your
age
thus
for
my
dutys
sake
i
rather
chose
to
cross

intended
drift
than
by
concealing
it
heap
on

a
pack
of
sorrows
which

when
they
have
judgd
me
fast
asleep
and
oftentimes
have
purposd
to
forbid
sir

her
company
and
my
court
but
fearing
lest
my
jealous
aim
might
err
and
so
unworthily
disgrace
the
man
a
rashness
that
i
ever
yet
have
shunnd
i
gave
him
gentle
looks
thereby
to
find
that
which
thyself
hast
now
disclosd
to
me
and
that
thou
mayst
perceive
my
fear
of
this
knowing
that
tender
youth
is
soon
suggested
i
nightly
lodge
her
in
an
upper
towr
the
key
whereof
myself
have
ever
kept
and
thence
she
cannot
be
conveyd
away
proteus

how

which
the
youthful

made
me
publisher
of

a
messenger
that
stays
to
bear
my
letters
to
my
friends
and
i
am
going
to
deliver
them
duke
be
they
of
much
import
valentine

but
signify
my
health
and
happy
being
at
your
court
duke
nay
then
no
matter
stay
with
me
awhile
i
am
to
break
with
thee
of
some
affairs
that
touch
me
near
wherein
thou
must
be
secret
tis
not
unknown
to
thee
that
i
have
sought
to
match
my
friend
sir
thurio
to
my
daughter
valentine
i
know
it
well
my
lord
and
sure
the
match
were
rich
and
honourable
besides
the
gentleman
is
full
of
virtue
bounty
worth
and
qualities
beseeming
such
a
wife
as
your
fair
daughter
cannot
your
grace
win
her
to
fancy
him
duke
no
trust
me
she
is
peevish
sullen
froward
proud
disobedient
stubborn
lacking
duty
neither
regarding
that
she
is
my
child
nor
fearing
me
as
if
i
were
her
father
and
may
i
say
to
thee
this
pride
of
hers
upon
advice
hath
drawn
my
love
from
her
and
where
i
thought
the
remnant
of
mine
age
should
have
been
cherishd
by
her
childlike
duty
i
now
am
full
resolvd
to
take
a
wife
and
turn
her
out
to
who
will
take
her
in
then
let
her
beauty
be
her
weddingdowr
for
me
and
my
possessions
she
esteems
not
valentine
what
would
your
grace
have
me
to
do
in
this
duke
there
is
a
lady
in
verona
here
whom
i
affect
but
she
is
nice
and
coy
and
nought
esteems
my
aged
eloquence
now
therefore
would
i
have
thee
to
my
tutor
for
long
agone
i
have
forgot
to
court
besides
the
fashion
of
the
time
is
changd
how
and
which
way
i
may
bestow
myself
to
be
regarded
in
her
sunbright
eye
valentine
win
her
with
gifts
if
she
respect
not
words
dumb
jewels
often
in
their
silent
kind
more
than
quick
words
do
move
a
womans
mind
duke
but
she
did
scorn
a
present
that
i
sent
her
valentine
a
woman
sometime
scorns
what
best
contents
her
send
her
another
never
give
her
oer
for
scorn
at
first
makes
afterlove
the
more
if
she
do
frown
tis
not
in
hate
of
you
but
rather
to
beget
more
love
in
you
if
she
do
chide
tis
not
to
have
you
gone
for
why
the
fools
are
mad
if
left
alone
take
no
repulse
whatever
she
doth
say
for
get
you
gone
she
doth
not
mean
away
flatter
and
praise
commend
extol
their
graces
though
neer
so
black
say
they
have
angels
faces
that
man
that
hath
a
tongue
i
say
is
no
man
if
with
his
tongue
he
cannot
win
a
woman
duke
but
she
i
mean
is
promisd
by
her
friends
unto
a
youthful
gentleman
of
worth
and
kept
severely
from
resort
of
men
that
no
man
hath
access
by
day
to
her
valentine
why
then
i
would
resort
to
her
by
night
duke
ay
but
the
doors
be
lockd
and
keys
kept
safe
that
no
man
hath
recourse
to
her
by
night
valentine
what
lets
but
one
may
enter
at
her
window
duke
her
chamber
is
aloft
far
from
the
ground
and
built
so
shelving
that
one
cannot
climb
it
without
apparent
hazard
of
his
life
valentine
why
then
a
ladder
quaintly
made
of
cords
to
cast
up
with
a
pair
of
anchoring
hooks
would
serve
to
scale
another
heros
towr
so
bold
leander
would
adventure
it
duke
now
as
thou
art
a
gentleman
of
blood
advise
me
where
i
may
have
such
a
ladder
valentine
when
would
you
use
it
pray
sir
tell
me
that
duke
this
very
night
for
love
is
like
a
child
that
longs
for
everything
that

by
seven
oclock
ill

a
ladder

their
king

bestowd
on

but
if

exit




scene
ii
milan
the
dukes
palace

enter
duke
and
thurio

duke
sir
thurio
fear
not
but
that
she
will
love
you
now
valentine
is
banishd
from
her
sight
thurio
since
his
exile
she
hath
despisd
me
most
forsworn
my
company
and
raild
at
me
that
i
am
desperate
of
obtaining
her
duke
this
weak
impress
of
love
is
as
a
figure
trenched
in
ice
which
with
an
hours
heat
dissolves
to
water
and
doth
lose
his
form
a
little
time
will
melt
her
frozen
thoughts
and
worthless
valentine
shall
be
forgot

enter
proteus

how
now
sir
proteus
is
your
countryman
according
to
our
proclamation
gone
proteus
gone
my
good
lord
duke
my
daughter
takes
his
going
grievously
proteus
a
little
time
my
lord
will
kill
that
grief
duke
so
i
believe
but
thurio
thinks
not
so
proteus
the
good
conceit
i
hold
of
thee
for
thou
hast
shown
some
sign
of
good
desert
makes
me
the
better
to
confer
with
thee
proteus
longer
than
i
prove
loyal
to
your
grace
let
me
not
live
to
look
upon
your
grace
duke
thou
knowst
how
willingly
i
would
effect
the
match
between
sir
thurio
and
my
daughter
proteus
i
do
my
lord
duke
and
also
i
think
thou
art
not
ignorant
how
she
opposes
her
against
my
will
proteus
she
did
my
lord
when
valentine
was
here
duke
ay
and
perversely
she
persevers
so
what
might
we
do
to
make
the
girl
forget
the
love
of
valentine
and
love
sir
thurio
proteus
the
best
way
is
to
slander
valentine
with
falsehood
cowardice
and
poor
descent
three
things
that
women
highly
hold
in
hate
duke
ay
but
shell
think
that
it
is
spoke
in
hate
proteus
ay
if
his
enemy
deliver
it
therefore
it
must
with
circumstance
be
spoken
by
one
whom
she
esteemeth
as
his
friend
duke
then
you
must
undertake
to
slander
him
proteus
and
that
my
lord
i
shall
be
loath
to
do
tis
an
ill
office
for
a
gentleman
especially
against
his
very
friend
duke
where
your
good
word
cannot
advantage
him
your
slander
never
can
endamage
him
therefore
the
office
is
indifferent
being
entreated
to
it
by
your
friend
proteus
you
have
prevaild
my
lord
if
i
can
do
it
by
aught
that
i
can
speak
in
his
dispraise
she
shall
not
long
continue
love
to
him
but
say
this
weed
her
love
from
valentine
it
follows
not
that
she
will
love
sir
thurio
thurio
therefore
as
you
unwind
her
love
from
him
lest
it
should
ravel
and
be
good
to
none
you
must
provide
to
bottom
it
on
me
which
must
be
done
by
praising
me
as
much
as
you
in
worth
dispraise
sir
valentine
duke
and
proteus
we
dare
trust
you
in
this
kind
because
we
know
on
valentines
report
you
are
already
loves
firm
votary
and
cannot
soon
revolt
and
change
your
mind
upon
this
warrant
shall
you
have
access
where
you
with
silvia
may
confer
at
large
for
she
is
lumpish
heavy
melancholy
and
for
your
friends
sake
will
be
glad
of
you
where
you
may
temper
her
by
your
persuasion
to
hate
young
valentine
and
love
my
friend
proteus
as
much
as
i
can
do
i
will
effect
but
you
sir
thurio
are
not
sharp
enough
you
must
lay
lime
to
tangle
her
desires
by
wailful
sonnets
whose
composed
rhymes
should
be
fullfraught
with
serviceable
vows
duke
ay
much
is
the
force
of
heavenbred
poesy
proteus
say
that
upon
the
altar
of
her
beauty
you
sacrifice
your
tears
your
sighs
your
heart
write
till
your
ink
be
dry
and
with
your
tears
moist
it
again
and
frame
some
feeling
line
that
may
discover
such
integrity
for
orpheus
lute
was
strung
with
poets
sinews
whose
golden
touch
could
soften

and

make

tame
and

this

she
not

fair
julia
she
hath
been
fairer
madam
than
she
is
when
she
did
think
my
master
lovd
her
well
she
in
my
judgment
was
as
fair
as
you
but
since
she
did
neglect
her
lookingglass
and
threw
her
sunexpelling
mask
away
the
air
hath
starvd
the
roses
in
her
cheeks
and
pinchd
the
lilytincture
of
her
face
that
now
she
is
become
as
black
as
i
silvia
how
tall
was
she

stature
for
at
pentecost
when
all
our
pageants
of

were
playd
our
youth
got
me
to
play
the
womans
part
and
i
was
trimmd
in
madam
julias
gown
which
served
me
as
fit
by
all
mens
judgments
as
if
the
garment
had
been
made
for
me
therefore
i
know
she
is
about
my
height
and
at
that
time
i
made
her
weep
a
good
for
i
did
play
a
lamentable
part
madam
twas
ariadne
passioning
for
theseus
perjury
and
unjust
flight
which
i
so
lively
acted
with
my
tears
that
my
poor
mistress
moved
therewithal
wept
bitterly
and
would
i
might
be
dead
if
i
in
thought
felt
not
her
very
sorrow
silvia
she
is
beholding
to
thee
gentle
youth
alas
poor
lady
desolate
and
left
i
weep
myself
to
think
upon
thy
words
here

is
my
purse

give
thee
this
for
thy
sweet
mistress

know
her
a
virtuous
gentlewoman
mild
and
beautiful
i
hope
my
masters
suit
will
be
but
cold
since
she
respects
my
mistress
love
so
much
alas
how
love
can
trifle
with
itself
here
is
her
picture
let
me
see
i
think
if
i
had
such
a
tire
this
face
of
mine
were
full
as
lovely
as
is
this
of
hers
and
yet
the
painter
flatterd
her
a
little
unless
i
flatter
with
myself
too
much
her
hair
is
auburn
mine
is
perfect
yellow
if
that
be
all
the
difference
in
his
love
ill
get
me
such
a
colourd
periwig
her
eyes
are
grey
as
glass
and
so
are
mine
ay
but
her
foreheads
low
and
mines
as
high
what
should
it
be
that
he
respects
in
her
but
i
can
make
respective
in
myself
if
this
fond
love
were
not
a
blinded
god
come
shadow
come
and
take
this
shadow
up
for
tis
thy
rival
o
thou
senseless
form
thou
shalt
be
worshippd
kissd
lovd
and
adord
and
were
there
sense
in
his
idolatry
my
substance
should
be
statue
in
thy
stead
ill
use
thee
kindly
for
thy
mistress
sake
that
usd
me
so
or
else
by
jove
i
vow
i
should
have
scratchd
out
your
unseeing
eyes
to
make
my
master
out
of
love
with
thee

she
says
it
is
a
fair

use
doth
breed
a
habit
in
a
man
this
shadowy
desert
unfrequented
woods
i
better
brook
than
flourishing
peopled
towns
here
can
i
sit
alone
unseen
of
any

to
the
nightingales
complaining
notes
tune
my
distresses
and
record
my
woes
o
thou
that
dost
inhabit
in
my
breast
leave
not
the
mansion
so
long
tenantless
lest
growing
ruinous

no

of
what
it
was

thy

their

have
some
unhappy
passenger
in

to

life
and
rescue
you
from
him
that
would
have
forcd
your
honour
and
your

vouchsafe
me
for
my
meed

less
than

i
am
sure
you
cannot
give
valentine

how
like
a
dream
is
this
i

most
unhappy
julia

and
me
when

your
presence
silvia
had
i
been
seized
by
a
hungry
lion
i
would
have
been
a
breakfast
to
the
beast

false
proteus
rescue
me
o
heaven
be
judge
how
i
love
valentine
whose
lifes
as
tender
to
me
as
my

what
dangerous
action
stood
it
next
to
death
would
i
not

one
calm
look
o
tis
the
curse
in
love
and
still
approvd
when
women
cannot
love
where
theyre
belovd
silvia
when
proteus
cannot
love
where
hes
belovd
read
over
julias
heart
thy
first
best
love
for
whose
dear
sake
thou
didst
then
rend
thy
faith
into
a
thousand
oaths
and
all
those
oaths
descended
into
perjury
to
love
me
thou
hast
no
faith
left
now
unless
thoudst
two
and
thats
far
worse
than
none
better

none
than
plural
faith

is
too
much
by
one
thou
counterfeit
to
thy
true
friend
proteus
in
love
who
respects
friend
silvia
all
men
but
proteus
proteus

if
the
gentle
spirit

leontes

enter

and
archidamus

archidamus
if
you
shall
chance
camillo
to
visit
bohemia
on
the
like
occasion
whereon
my
services
are
now
on
foot
you
shall
see
as
i
have
said
great
difference
betwixt
our
bohemia
and
your
sicilia
camillo
i
think
this
coming
summer
the
king
of
sicilia
means
to
pay
bohemia
the
visitation
which
he
justly
owes
him
archidamus
wherein
our
entertainment
shall
shame
us
we
will
be
justified
in
our
loves
for
indeed
camillo
beseech
you
archidamus
verily
i
speak
it
in
the
freedom
of
my
knowledge
we
cannot
with
such
magnificence
in
so
rare
i
know
not
what
to
say
we
will
give
you
sleepy
drinks
that
your
senses
unintelligent
of
our
insufficience
may
though
they
cannot
praise
us
as
little
accuse
us
camillo
you
pay
a
great
deal
too
dear
for
whats
given
freely
archidamus
believe
me
i
speak
as
my
understanding
instructs
me
and
as
mine
honesty
puts
it
to
utterance
camillo
sicilia
cannot
show
himself
overkind
to
bohemia
they
were
traind
together
in
their
childhoods
and
there
rooted
betwixt
them
then
such
an
affection
which
cannot
choose
but
branch
now
since
their
more
mature
dignities
and
royal
necessities
made
separation
of
their
society
their
encounters
though
not
personal
have
been
royally
attorneyed
with
interchange
of
gifts
letters
loving
embassies
that
they
have
seemd
to
be
together
though
absent
shook
hands
as
over
a
vast
and
embracd
as
it
were
from
the
ends
of
opposed
winds
the
heavens
continue
their
loves
archidamus
i
think
there
is
not
in
the
world
either
malice
or
matter
to
alter
it
you
have
an
unspeakable
comfort
of
your
young
prince
mamillius
it
is
a
gentleman
of
the
greatest
promise
that
ever
came
into
my
note
camillo
i
very
well
agree
with
you
in
the
hopes
of
him
it
is
a
gallant
child
one
that
indeed
physics
the
subject
makes
old
hearts
fresh
they
that
went
on
crutches
ere
he
was
born
desire
yet
their
life
to
see
him
a
man
archidamus
would
they
else
be
content
to
die
camillo
yes
if
there
were
no
other
excuse
why
they
should
desire
to
live
archidamus
if
the
king
had
no
son
they
would
desire
to
live
on
crutches
till
he
had
one
exeunt

negligence
his
folly
fear
among
the
infinite
doings
of
the
world
sometime
puts
forth
in
your
affairs
my
lord
if
ever
i
were
wilfullnegligent
it
was
my
folly
if
industriously
i
playd
the
fool
it
was
my
negligence
not
weighing
well
the
end
if
ever
fearful
to
do
a
thing
where
i
the
issue
doubted
whereof
the
execution
did
cry
out
against
the
nonperformance
twas
a
fear
which
oft
infects
the
wisest
these
my
lord
are
such
allowd
infirmities
that
honesty
is
never
free
of
but
beseech
your
grace
be
plainer
with
me
let
me
know
my
trespass
by
its
own
visage
if
i
then
deny
it
tis
none
of
mine
leontes
ha
not
you
seen
camillo
but
thats
past
doubt
you
have
or
your
eyeglass
is
thicker
than
a
cuckolds
horn
or
heard
for
to
a
vision
so
apparent
rumour
cannot
be
mute
or
thought
for
cogitation
resides
not
in
that
man
that
does
not
think
my
wife
is
slippery
if
thou
wilt
confess
or
else
be
impudently
negative
to
have
nor
eyes
nor
ears
nor
thought
then
say
my
wifes
a
hobbyhorse
deserves
a
name
as
rank
as
any
flaxwench
that
puts
to
before
her
trothplight
sayt
and
justifyt
camillo
i
would
not
be
a
standerby
to
hear
my
sovereign
mistress
clouded
so
without
my
present
vengeance
taken
shrew
my
heart
you
never
spoke
what
did
become
you
less
than
this
which
to
reiterate
were
sin
as
deep
as
that
though
true
leontes
is
whispering
nothing
is
leaning
cheek
to
cheek
is
meeting
noses
kissing
with
inside
lip
stopping
the
career
of
laughter
with
a
sigh
a
note
infallible
of
breaking
honesty
horsing
foot
on
foot
skulking
in
corners
wishing
clocks
more
swift
hours
minutes
noon
midnight
and
all
eyes
blind
with
the
pin
and
web
but
theirs
theirs
only
that
would
unseen
be
wicked
is
this
nothing
why
then
the
world
and
all
thats
int
is
nothing
the
covering
sky
is
nothing
bohemia
nothing
my
is
nothing
nor
nothing
have
these
nothings
if
this
be
nothing
camillo
good
my
lord
be
curd
of
this
diseasd
opinion
and
betimes
for
tis
most
dangerous
leontes
say
it
be
tis
true
camillo
no
no
my
lord
leontes
it
is
you
lie
you
lie
i
say
thou
liest
camillo
and
i
hate
thee
pronounce
thee
a
gross
lout
a
mindless
slave
or
else
a
hovering
temporizer
that
canst
with
thine
eyes
at
once
see
good
and
evil
inclining
to
them
both
were
my
wifes
liver
infected
as
her
life
she
would
not
live
the
running
of
one
glass
camillo
who
does
her
leontes
why
he
that
wears
her
like
her
medal
hanging
about
his
neck
bohemia
who
if
i
had
servants
true
about
me
that
bare
eyes
to
see
alike
mine
honour
as
their
profits
their
own
particular
thrifts
they
would
do
that
which
should
undo
more
doing
ay
and
thou
his
cupbearer
whom
i
from
meaner
form
have
benchd
and
reard
to
worship
who
mayst
see
plainly
as
heaven
sees
earth
and
earth
sees
heaven
how
i
am
galld
mightst
bespice
a
cup
to
give
mine
enemy
a
lasting
wink
which
draught
to
me
were
cordial
camillo
sir
my
lord
i
could
do
this
and
that
with
no
rash
potion
but
with
a
lingring
dram
that
should
not
work
maliciously
like
poison
but
i
cannot
believe
this
crack
to
be
in
my
dread
mistress
so
sovereignly
being
honourable
i
have
lovd
thee
leontes
make
that
thy
question
and
go
rot
dost
think
i
am
so
muddy
so
unsettled
to
appoint
myself
in
this
vexation
sully
the
purity
and
whiteness
of
my
sheets
which
to
preserve
is
sleep
which
being
spotted
is
goads
thorns
nettles
tails
of
wasps
give
scandal
to
the
blood
o
th
prince
my
son
who
i
do
think
is
mine
and
love
as
mine
without
ripe
moving
to
t
would
i
do
this
could
man
so
blench
camillo
i
must
believe
you
sir
i
do
and
will
fetch
off
bohemia
fort
provided
that
when
hes
removd
your
highness
will
take
again
your
queen
as
yours
at
first
even
for
your
sons
sake
and
thereby
for
sealing
the
injury
of
tongues
in
courts
and
kingdoms
known
and
allied
to
yours
leontes
thou
dost
advise
me
even
so
as
i
mine
own
course
have
set
down
ill
give
no
blemish
to
her
honour
none
camillo
my
lord
go
then
and
with
a
countenance
as
clear
as
friendship
wears
at
feasts
keep
with
bohemia
and
with
your
queen
i
am
his
cupbearer
if
from
me
he
have
wholesome
beverage
account

not
your
servant
leontes
this
is
all
dot
and
thou
hast
the
one
half
of
my
heart
dot

splitst
thine
own
camillo
ill
dot
my
lord
leontes
i
will
seem
friendly
as
thou
hast
advisd
me


exit
camillo
o
miserable
lady
but
for
me
what
case
stand
i
in
i
must
be
the
poisoner
of
good
polixenes
and
my
ground
to
dot
is
the
obedience
to
a
master
one
who
in
rebellion
with
himself
will
have
all
that
are
his
so
too
to
do
this
deed
promotion
follows
if
i
could
find
example
of
thousands
that
had
struck
anointed
kings
and
flourishd
after
id
not
dot
but
since
nor
brass
nor
stone
nor
parchment
bears
not
one
let
villainy
itself
forsweart
i
must
forsake
the
court
to
dot
or
no
is
certain
to
me
a
breakneck
happy
star
reign
now
here
comes
bohemia

enter
polixenes

polixenes
this
is
strange
methinks
my
favour
here
begins
to
warp
not
speak
good
day
camillo
camillo
hail
most
royal
sir
polixenes
what
is
the
news
i
th
court
camillo
none
rare
my
lord
polixenes
the
king
hath
on
him
such
a
countenance
as
he
had
lost
some
province
and
a
region
lovd
as
he
loves
himself
even
now
i
met
him
with
customary
compliment
when
he
wafting
his
eyes
to
th
contrary
and
falling
a
lip
of
much
contempt
speeds
from
me
so
leaves
me
to
consider
what
is
breeding
that
changes
thus
his
manners
camillo
i
dare
not
know
my
lord
polixenes
how
dare
not
do
not
do
you
know
and
dare
not
be
intelligent
to
me
tis
thereabouts
for
to
yourself
what
you
do
know
you
must
and
cannot
say
you
dare
not
good
camillo
your
changd
complexions
are
to
me
a
mirror
which
shows
me
mine
changd
too
for
i
must
be
a
party
in
this
alteration
finding
myself
thus
alterd
witht
camillo
there
is
a
sickness
which
puts
some
of
us
in
distemper
but
i
cannot
name
the
disease
and
it
is
caught
of
you
that
yet
are
well
polixenes
how
caught
of
me
make
me
not
sighted
like
the
basilisk
i
have
lookd
on
thousands
who
have
sped
the
better
by
my
regard
but
killd
none
so
camillo
as
you
are
certainly
a
gentleman
thereto
clerklike
experiencd
which
no
less
adorns
our
gentry
than
our
parents
noble
names
in
whose
success
we
are
gentle
i
beseech
you
if
you
know
aught
which
does
behove
my
knowledge
thereof
to
be
informd
imprisont
not
in
ignorant
concealment
camillo
i
may
not
answer
polixenes
a
sickness
caught
of
me
and
yet
i
well
i
must
be
answerd
dost
thou
hear
camillo
i
conjure
thee
by
all
the
parts
of
man
which
honour
does
acknowledge
whereof
the
least
is
not
this
suit
of
mine
that
thou
declare
what
incidency
thou
dost
guess
of
harm
is
creeping
toward
me
how
far
off
how
near
which
way
to
be
prevented
if
to
be
if
not
how
best
to
bear
it
camillo
sir
i
will
tell
you
since
i
am
chargd
in
honour
and
by
him
that
i
think
honourable
therefore
mark
my
counsel
which
must
be
evn
as
swiftly
followed
as
i
mean
to
utter
it
or
both
yourself
and
me
cry
lost
and
so
goodnight
polixenes
on
good
camillo
camillo
i
am
appointed
him
to
murder
you
polixenes
by
whom
camillo
camillo
by
the
king
polixenes
for
what
camillo
he
thinks
nay
with
all
confidence
he
swears
as
he
had
seen
t
or
been
an
instrument
to
vice
you
tot
that
you
have
touchd
his
queen
forbiddenly
polixenes
o
then
my
best
blood
turn
to
an
infected
jelly
and
my
name
be
yokd
with
his
that
did
betray
the
best
turn
then
my
freshest
reputation
to
a
savour
that
may
strike
the
dullest
nostril
where
i
arrive
and
my
approach
be
shunnd
nay
hated
too
worse
than
the
greatst
infection
that
eer
was
heard
or
read
camillo
swear
his
thought
over
by
each
particular
star
in
heaven
and
by
all
their
influences
you
may
as
well
forbid
the
sea
for
to
obey
the
moon
as
or
by
oath
remove
or
counsel
shake
the
fabric
of
his
folly
whose
foundation
is
pild
upon
his
faith
and
will
continue
the
standing
of
his
body
polixenes
how
should
this
grow
camillo
i
know
not
but
i
am
sure
tis
safer
to
avoid
whats
grown
than
question
how
tis
born
if
therefore
you
dare
trust
my
honesty
that
lies
enclosed
in
this
trunk
which
you
shall
bear
along
impawnd
away
tonight
your
followers
i
will
whisper
to
the
business
and
will
by
twos
and
threes
at
several
posterns
clear
them
o
th
city
for
myself
ill
put
my
fortunes
to
your
service
which
are
here
by
this
discovery
lost
be
not
uncertain
for
by
the
honour
of
my
parents
i
have
uttred
truth
which
if
you
seek
to
prove
i
dare
not
stand
by
nor
shall
you
be
safer
than
one
condemnd
by
the
kings
own
mouth
thereon
his
execution
sworn
polixenes
i
do
believe
thee
i
saw
his
heart
ins
face
give
me
thy
hand
be
pilot
to
me
and
thy
places
shall
still
neighbour
mine
my
ships
are
ready
and
my
people
did
expect
my
hence
departure
two
days
ago
this
jealousy
is
for
a
precious
creature
as
shes
rare
must
it
be
great
and
as
his
persons
mighty
must
it
be
violent
and
as
he
does
conceive
he
is
dishonourd
by
a
man
which
ever
professd
to
him
why
his
revenges
must
in
that
be
made
more
bitter

bearst
my
life
off

opinion
alack
for
lesser
knowledge
how
accursd
in

present
th
abhorrd
ingredient
to
his
eye
make
known
how
he
hath
drunk
he
cracks
his
gorge
his
sides
with
violent
hefts
i
have
drunk

help
in
this
his
pander
there
is
a
plot
against
my
life
my
crown
alls
true
that
is
mistrusted
that
false
villain
whom
i
employd
was
preemployd
by
him
he
has
discoverd
my
design
and
i
remain
a
pinchd
thing
yea
a
very
trick
for
them
to
play
at
will
how
came
the
posterns
so
easily
open
first
lord
by
his
great
authority
which
often
hath
no
less
prevaild
than
so
on
your
command
leontes
i
knowt
too
well
give
me
the
boy
i
am
glad
you
did
not
nurse
him
though
he
does
bear
some
signs
of
me
yet
you
have
too
much
blood
in
him
hermione
what
is
this
sport
leontes
bear
the
boy
hence
he
shall
not
come
about
her
away
with
him
and
let
her
sport
herself
mamillius
is
led
out
with
that
shes
big
with
for
tis
polixenes
has
made
thee
swell
thus
hermione
but
id
say
he
had
not
and
ill
be
sworn
you
would
believe
my
saying
howeer
you
lean
to
th
nayward
leontes
you
my
lords
look
on
her
mark
her
well
be
but
about
to
say
she
is
a
goodly
lady
and
the
justice
of
your
hearts
will
thereto
ad
tis
pity
shes
not
honest
honourable
praise
her
but
for
this
her
withoutdoor
form
which
on
my
faith
deserves
high
speech
and
straight
the
shrug
the
hum
or
ha
these
petty
brands
that
calumny
doth
use
o
i
am
out
that
mercy
does
for
calumny
will
sear
virtue
itself
these
shrugs
these
hums
and
has
when
you
have
said
shes
goodly
come
between
ere
you
can
say
shes
honest
but
bet
known
from
him
that
has
most
cause
to
grieve
it
should
be
shes
an
adultress
hermione
should
a
villain
say
so
the
most
replenishd
villain
in
the
world
he
were
as
much
more
villain
you
my
lord
do
but
mistake
leontes
you
have
mistook
my
lady
polixenes
for
leontes
o
thou
thing
which
ill
not
call
a
creature
of
thy
place
lest
barbarism
making
me
the
precedent
should
a
like
language
use
to
all
degrees
and
mannerly
distinguishment
leave

o
the

how
ceremonious
solemn
and
unearthly
it
was

th
offring

but
of
all
the

and
the
eardeafning
voice
o
th

kin
to
joves

so
surprisd

was

discover

the
daughter
of
a
king
our
wife
and
one
of
us
too
much
belovd
let
us
be
cleard
of

of

thou
art
here
accused
and
arraigned
of
high
treason
in
committing
adultery
with
polixenes
king
of
bohemia
and
conspiring
with
camillo
to
take
away
the
life
of
our
sovereign
lord
the
king
thy
royal
husband
the
pretence
whereof
being
by
circumstances
partly
laid
open
thou
hermione
contrary
to
the
faith
and
allegiance
of
true
subject
didst
counsel
and
aid
them
for
their
better
safety
to
fly
away
by
night
hermione
since
what
i
am
to
say
must
be
but
that
which
contradicts
my
accusation
and
the
testimony
on
my
part
no
other
but
what
comes
from
myself
it
shall
scarce
boot
me
to
say
not
guilty
mine
integrity
being
counted

shall
as
i

it
be
so
receivd
but
thus
if
powrs
divine
behold
our
human
actions
as
they
do
i
doubt
not
then
but
innocence
shall
make
false
accusation
blush
and
tyranny
tremble
at
patience
you
my
lord
best
know
who
least
will
seem
to
do
so
my
past
life
hath
been
as
continent
as
chaste
as
true
as
i
am
now
unhappy
which
is
more
than
history
can
pattern
though
devisd
and
playd
to
take
spectators
for
behold
me
a
fellow
of
the
royal
bed
which
owe
a
moiety
of
the
throne
a
great
kings
daughter
the
mother
to
a
hopeful
prince
here
standing
to
prate
and
talk
for
life
and
honour
fore
who
please
to
come
and
hear
for
life
i
prize
it
as
i
weigh
grief
which
i
would
spare
for
honour
tis
a
derivative
from
me
to
mine
and
only
that
i
stand
for
i
appeal
to
your
own
conscience
sir
before
polixenes
came
to
your
court
how
i
was
in
your
grace
how
merited
to
be
so
since
he
came
with
what
encounter
so
uncurrent
i
have
straind
t
appear
thus
if
one
jot
beyond
the
bound
of
honour
or
in
act
or
will
that
way
inclining
hardned
be
the
hearts
of
all
that
hear
me
and
my
nearst
of
kin
cry
fie
upon
my
grave
leontes
i
neer
heard
yet
that
any
of
these
bolder
vices
wanted
less
impudence
to
gainsay
what
they
did
than
to
perform
it
first
hermione
thats
true
enough
though
tis
a
saying
sir
not
due
to
me
leontes
you
will
not
own
it
hermione
more
than
mistress
of
which
comes
to
me
in
name
of
fault
i
must
not
at
all
acknowledge
for
polixenes
with
whom
i
am
accusd
i
do
confess
i
lovd
him
as
in
honour
he
requird
with
such
a
kind
of
love
as
might
become
a
lady
like
me
with
a
love
even
such
so
and
no
other
as
yourself
commanded
which
not
to
have
done
i
think
had
been
in
me
both
disobedience
and
ingratitude
to
you
and
toward
your
friend
whose
love
had
spoke
ever
since
it
could
speak
from
an
infant
freely
that
it
was
yours
now
for
conspiracy
i
know
not
how
it
tastes
though
it
be
dishd
for
me
to
try
how
all
i
know
of
it
is
that
camillo
was
an
honest
man
and
why
he
left
your
court
the
gods
themselves
wotting
no
more
than
i
are
ignorant
leontes
you
knew
of
his
departure
as
you
know
what
you
have
undertaen
to
do
ins
absence
hermione
sir
you
speak
a
language
that
i
understand
not
my
life
stands
in
the
level
of
your
dreams
which
ill
lay
down
leontes
your
actions
are
my
dreams
you
had
a
bastard
by
polixenes
and
i
but
dreamd
it
as
you
were
past
all
shame
those
of
your
fact
are
so
so
past
all
truth
which
to
deny
concerns
more
than
avails
for
as
thy
brat
hath
been
cast
out
like
to
itself
no
father
owning
it
which
is
indeed
more
criminal
in
thee
than
it
so
thou
shalt
feel
our
justice
in
whose
easiest
passage
look
for
no
less
than
death
hermione
sir
spare
your
threats
the
bug
which
you
would
fright
me
with
i
seek
to
me
can
life
be
no
commodity
the
crown
and
comfort
of
my
life
your
favour
i
do
give
lost
for
i
do
feel
it
gone
but
know
not
how
it
went
my
second
joy
and
first
fruits
of
my
body
from
his
presence
i
am
barrd
like
one
infectious
my
third
comfort
starrd
most
unluckily
is
from
my
breast
the
innocent
milk
in
it
most
innocent
mouth
hald
out
to
murder
myself
on
every
post
proclaimd
a
strumpet
with
immodest
hatred
the
childbed
privilege
denied
which
longs
to
women
of
all
fashion
lastly
hurried
here
to
this
place
i
th
open
air
before
i
have
got
strength
of
limit
now
my
liege
tell
me
what
blessings
i
have
here
alive
that
i
should
fear
to
die
therefore
proceed
but
yet
hear
this
mistake
me
not
no
life
i
prize
it
not
a
straw
but
for
mine
honour
which
i
would
free
if
i
shall
be
condemnd
upon
surmises

proofs
sleeping

what
your
jealousies

camillo
for
the

to
poison
my

polixenes
which
had
been
done
but
that
the

with
death

with
reward
did
threaten

encourage
him
not

i
lay
thrice
bowd
before

gasping
to

some
speech
her
eyes
became
two
spouts
the
fury
spent

a

it

fifteen
years

i

my

though
i
have
for
the
most
part
been
aired
abroad
i
desire
to
lay
my
bones
there
besides
the
penitent
king
my
master
hath
sent
for
me
to
whose
feeling
sorrows
i
might
be
some
allay

i

is

thou

wipe
not
out
the
rest
of
thy
services
by
leaving
me
now
the
need
i
have
of
thee
thine
own
goodness
hath
made
better
not
to
have
had
thee
than
thus
to
want
thee
thou
having
made
me
businesses
which
none
without
thee
can
sufficiently
manage
must
either
stay
to
execute
them
thyself
or
take
away
with
thee
the
very
services
thou
hast
done
which
if
i
have
not
enough
considered
as
too
much
i
cannot
to
be
more
thankful
to
thee
shall
be
my
study
and
my
profit
therein
the
heaping
friendships
of
that
fatal
country
sicilia
prithee
speak
no
more
whose
very
naming
punishes
me
with
the
remembrance
of
that
penitent
as
thou
callst
him
and
reconciled
king
my
brother
whose
loss
of
his
most
precious
queen
and
children
are
even
now
to
be
afresh
lamented
say
to
me
when
sawst
thou
the
prince
florizel
my
son
kings
are
no
less
unhappy
their
issue
not
being
gracious
than
they
are
in
losing
them
when
they
have
approved
their
virtues
camillo
sir
it
is
three
days
since
i
saw
the
prince
what
his
happier
affairs
may
be
are
to
me
unknown
but
i
have
missingly
noted
he
is
of
late
much
retired
from
court
and
is
less
frequent
to
his
princely
exercises
than
formerly
he
hath
appeared
polixenes
i
have
considered
so
much
camillo
and
with
some
care
so
far
that
i
have
eyes
under
my
service
which
look
upon
his
removedness
from
whom
i
have
this
intelligence
that
he
is
seldom
from
the
house
of
a
most
homely
shepherd
a
man
they
say
that
from
very
nothing
and
beyond
the
imagination
of
his
neighbours
is
grown
into
an
unspeakable
estate
camillo
i
have
heard
sir
of
such
a
man
who
hath
a
daughter
of
most
rare
note
the
report
of
her
is
extended
more
than
can
be
thought
to
begin
from
such
a
cottage
polixenes
thats
likewise
part
of
my
intelligence
but
i
fear
the
angle
that
plucks
our
son
thither
thou
shalt
accompany
us
to
the
place
where
we
will
not
appearing
what
we
are
have
some
question
with
the
shepherd
from
whose
simplicity
i
think
it
not
uneasy
to
get
the
cause
of
my
sons
resort
thither
prithee
be
my
present
partner
in
this
business
and
lay
aside
the
thoughts
of

willingly
obey
your

is
this
which
dances
with
your

shepherd
they
call
him
doricles
and
boasts
himself
to
have
a
worthy
feeding
but
i
have
it
upon
his
own
report
and
i
believe
it
he
looks
like
sooth
he
says
he
loves
my
daughter

think
so
too
for
never
gazd
the
moon
upon
the
water
as
hell
stand
and
read
as
twere
my
daughters
eyes
and
to
be
plain
i
think
there
is
not
half
a
kiss
to
choose
who
loves
another
best
polixenes
she
dances
featly
shepherd
so
she
does
any
thing

by

after

trust
to
thee
camillo
have
you
thought
on
a
place
whereto
youll
go
florizel
not
any
yet
but
as
th
unthoughton
accident
is
guilty
to
what
we
wildly
do
so
we
profess
ourselves
to
be
the
slaves
of
chance
and
flies
of
every
wind
that
blows
camillo

i
see
leontes
opening
his
free
arms
and
weeping
his
welcomes
forth
asks
thee
there
son
forgiveness
as
twere
i
th

kisses
the

of
your
fresh

oer
and
oer
divides
him
twixt
his
unkindness
and
his

th
one
he
chides
to

i
shall
review

act
v
scene
i
sicilia
the
palace
of
leontes

enter
leontes
cleomenes
dion
paulina
and
others

cleomenes
sir
you
have
done
enough
and
have
performd
a
saintlike
sorrow
no
fault
could
you
make
which
you
have
not
redeemd
indeed
paid
down
more
penitence
than
done
trespass
at
the
last
do
as
the
heavens
have
done
forget
your
evil
with
them
forgive
yourself
leontes
whilst
i
remember
her
and
her
virtues
i
cannot
forget
my
blemishes
in
them
and
so
still
think
of
the
wrong
i
did
myself
which
was
so
much
that
heirless
it
hath
made
my
kingdom
and
destroyd
the
sweetst
companion
that
eer
man
bred
his
hopes
out
of
paulina
true
too
true
my
lord
if
one
by
one
you
wedded
all
the
world
or
from
the
all
that
are
took
something
good
to
make
a
perfect
woman
she
you
killd
would
be
unparalleld
leontes
i
think
so
killd
she
i
killd
i
did
so
but
thou
strikst
me
sorely
to
say
i
did
it
is
as
bitter
upon
thy
tongue
as
in
my
thought
now
good
now
say
so
but
seldom
cleomenes
not
at
all
good
lady
you
might
have
spoken
a
thousand
things
that
would
have
done
the
time
more
benefit
and
gracd
your
kindness
better
paulina
you
are
one
of
those
would
have
him
wed
again
dion
if
you
would
not
so
you
pity
not
the
state
nor
the
remembrance
of
his
most
sovereign
name
consider
little
what
dangers
by
his
highness
fail
of
issue
may
drop
upon
his
kingdom
and
devour
incertain
lookerson
what
were
more
holy
than
to
rejoice
the
former
queen
is
well
what
holier
than
for
royaltys
repair
for
present
comfort
and
for
future
good
to
bless
the
bed
of
majesty
again
with
a
sweet
fellow
tot
paulina
there
is
none
worthy
respecting
her
thats
gone
besides
the
gods
will
have
fulfilld
their
secret
purposes
for
has
not
the
divine
apollo
said
ist
not
the
tenour
of
his
oracle
that
king
leontes
shall
not
have
an
heir
till
his
lost
child
be
found
which
that
it
shall
is
all
as
monstrous
to
our
human
reason
as
my
antigonus
to
break
his
grave
and
come
again
to
me
who
on
my
life
did
perish
with
the
infant
tis
your
counsel
my
lord
should
to
the
heavens
be
contrary
oppose
against
their
wills

to
leontes

care
not
for
issue
the
crown
will
find
an
heir
great
alexander
left
his
to
th
worthiest
so
his
successor
was
like
to
be
the
best
leontes
good
paulina
who
hast
the
memory
of
hermione
i
know
in
honour
o
that
ever
i
had
squard
me
to
thy
counsel
then
even
now
i
might
have
lookd
upon
my
queens
full
eyes
have
taken
treasure
from
her
lips
paulina
and
left
them
more
rich
for
what
they
yielded
leontes
thou
speakst
truth
no
more
such
wives
therefore
no
wife
one
worse
and
better
usd
would
make
her
sainted
spirit
again
possess
her
corpse
and
on
this
stage
where
we
offend
her
now
appear
soulvexd
and
begin
why
to
me
paulina
had
she
such
power
she
had
just
cause
leontes
she
had
and
would
incense
me
to
murder
her
i
married
paulina
i
should
so
were
i
the
ghost
that
walkd
id
bid
you
mark
her
eye
and
tell
me
for
what
dull
part
int
you
chose
her
then
id
shriek
that
even
your
ears
should
rift
to
hear
me
and
the
words
that
followd
should
be
remember
mine
leontes
stars
stars
and
all
eyes
else
dead
coals
fear
thou
no
wife
ill
have
no
wife
paulina
paulina
will
you
swear
never
to
marry
but
by
my
free
leave
leontes
never
paulina
so
be
blest
my
spirit
paulina
then
good
my
lords
bear
witness
to
his
oath
cleomenes
you
tempt
him
overmuch
paulina
unless
another
as
like
hermione
as
is
her
picture
affront
his
eye
cleomenes
good
madam
paulina
i
have
done
yet
if
my
lord
will
marry
if
you
will
sir
no
remedy
but
you
will
give
me
the
office
to
choose
you
a
queen
she
shall
not
be
so
young
as
was
your
former
but
she
shall
be
such
as
walkd
your
first
queens
ghost
it
should
take
joy
to
see
her
in
your
arms
leontes
my
true
paulina
we
shall
not
marry
till
thou
bidst
us
paulina
that
shall
be
when
your
first
queens
again
in
breath
never
till
then

enter
a
gentleman

gentleman
one
that
gives
out
himself
prince
florizel
son
of
polixenes
with
his
princess
she
the
fairest
i
have
yet
beheld
desires
access
to
your
high
presence
leontes
what
with
him
he
comes
not
like
to
his
fathers
greatness
his
approach
so
out
of
circumstance
and
sudden
tells
us
tis
not
a
visitation
framd
but
forcd
by
need
and
accident
what
train
gentleman
but
few
and
those
but
mean
leontes
his
princess
say
you
with
him
gentleman
ay
the
most
peerless
piece
of
earth
i
think
that
eer
the
sun
shone
bright
on
paulina
o
hermione
as
every
present
time
doth
boast
itself
above
a
better
gone
so
must
thy
grave
give
way
to
whats
seen
now
sir
you
yourself
have
said
and
writ
so
but
your
writing
now
is
colder
than
that
theme
she
had
not
been
nor
was
not
to
be
equalld
thus
your
verse
flowd
with
her
beauty
once
tis
shrewdly
ebbd
to
say
you
have
seen
a
better
gentleman
pardon
madam
the
one
i
have
almost
forgot
your
pardon
the
other
when
she
has
obtaind
your
eye
will
have
your
tongue
too
this
is
a
creature
would
she
begin
a
sect
might
quench
the
zeal
of
all
professors
else
make
proselytes
of
who
she
but
bid
follow
paulina
how
not
women
gentleman
women
will
love
her
that
she
is
a
woman
more
worth
than
any
man
men
that
she
is
the
rarest
of
all
women
leontes
go
cleomenes
yourself
assisted
with
your
honourd
friends
bring
them
to
our
embracement























exeunt
still
tis
strange
he
thus
should
steal
upon
us
paulina
had
our
prince
jewel
of
children
seen
this
hour
he
had
paird
well
with
this
lord
there
was
not
full
a
month
between
their
births
leontes
prithee
no
more
cease
thou
knowst
he
dies
to
me
again
when
talkd
of
sure
when
i
shall
see
this
gentleman
thy
speeches
will
bring
me
to
consider
that
which
may
unfurnish
me
of
reason

reenter
cleomenes
with
florizel
perdita
and
attendants

they
are
come
your
mother
was
most
true
to
wedlock
prince
for
she
did
print
your
royal
father
off
conceiving
you
were
i
but
twentyone
your
fathers
image
is
so
hit
in
you
his
very
air
that
i
should
call
you
brother
as
i
did
him
and
speak
of
something
wildly
by
us
performd
before
most
dearly
welcome
and
your
fair
princess
goddess
o
alas
i
lost
a
couple
that
twixt
heaven
and
earth
might
thus
have
stood
begetting
wonder
as
you
gracious
couple
do
and
then
i
lost
all
mine
own
folly
the
society
amity
too
of
your
brave
father
whom
though
bearing
misery
i
desire
my
life
once
more
to
look
on
him
florizel
by
his
command
have
i
here
touchd
sicilia
and
from
him
give
you
all
greetings
that
a
king
at
friend
can
send
his
brother
and
but
infirmity
which
waits
upon
worn
times
hath
something
seizd
his
wishd
ability
he
had
himself
the
lands
and
waters
twixt
your
throne
and
his
measurd
to
look
upon
you
whom
he
loves
he
bade
me
say
so
more
than
all
the
sceptres
and
those
that
bear
them
living
leontes
o
my
brother
good
gentleman
the
wrongs
i
have
done
thee
stir
afresh
within
me
and
these
thy
offices
so
rarely
kind
are
as
interpreters
of
my
behindhand
slackness
welcome
hither
as
is
the
spring
to
th
earth
and
hath
he
too
exposd
this
paragon
to
th
fearful
usage
at
least
ungentle
of
the
dreadful
neptune
to
greet
a
man
not
worth
her
pains
much
less
th
adventure
of
her
person
florizel
good
my
lord
she
came
from

too
much
youth
int
not
a
month
fore
your
queen
died
she
was
more
worth
such
gazes
than
what
you
look
on
now
leontes
i
thought
of
her
even
in
these
looks
i
made

to
florizel

but
your
petition
is
yet
unanswerd
i
will
to
your

your
honour
not

exeunt




scene
ii
sicilia
before
the
palace
of
leontes

enter
autolycus
and
a
gentleman

autolycus
beseech
you
sir
were
you
present
at
this
relation
first
gentleman
i
was
by
at
the
opening
of
the
fardel
heard
the
old
shepherd
deliver
the
manner
how
he
found
it
whereupon
after
a
little
amazedness
we
were
all
commanded
out
of
the
chamber
only
this
methought
i
heard
the
shepherd
say
he
found
the
child
autolycus
i
would
most
gladly
know
the
issue
of
it
first
gentleman
i
make
a
broken
delivery
of
the
business
but
the
changes
i
perceived
in
the
king
and
camillo
were
very
notes
of
admiration
they
seemd
almost
with
staring
on
one
another
to
tear
the
cases
of
their
eyes
there
was
speech
in
their
dumbness
language
in
their
very
gesture
they
lookd
as
they
had
heard
of
a
world
ransomd
or
one
destroyed
a
notable
passion
of
wonder
appeared
in
them
but
the
wisest
beholder
that
knew
no
more
but
seeing
could
not
say
if
th
importance
were
joy
or
sorrow
but
in
the
extremity
of
the
one
it
must
needs
be

enter
another
gentleman

here
comes
a
gentleman
that
happily
knows
more
the
news
rogero
second
gentleman
nothing
but
bonfires
the
oracle
is
fulfilld
the
kings
daughter
is
found
such
a
deal
of
wonder
is
broken
out
within
this
hour
that
balladmakers
cannot
be
able
to
express
it

enter
another
gentleman

here
comes
the
lady
paulinas
steward
he
can
deliver
you
more
how
goes
it
now
sir
this
news
which
is
calld
true
is
so
like
an
old
tale
that
the
verity
of
it
is
in
strong
suspicion
has
the
king
found
his
heir
third
gentleman
most
true
if
ever
truth
were
pregnant
by
circumstance
that
which
you
hear
youll
swear
you
see
there
is
such
unity
in
the
proofs
the
mantle
of
queen
hermiones
her
jewel
about
the
neck
of
it
the
letters
of
antigonus
found
with
it
which
they
know
to
be
his
character
the
majesty
of
the
creature
in
resemblance
of
the
mother
the
affection
of
nobleness
which
nature
shows
above
her
breeding
and
many
other
evidences
proclaim
her
with
all
certainty
to
be
the
kings
daughter
did
you
see
the
meeting
of
the
two
kings
second
gentleman
no
third
gentleman
then
you
have
lost
a
sight
which
was
to
be
seen
cannot
be
spoken
of
there
might
you
have
beheld
one
joy
crown
another
so
and
in
such
manner
that
it
seemd
sorrow
wept
to
take
leave
of
them
for
their
joy
waded
in
tears
there
was
casting
up
of
eyes
holding
up
of
hands
with
countenance
of
such
distraction
that
they
were
to
be
known
by
garment
not
by
favour
our
king
being
ready
to
leap
out
of
himself
for
joy
of
his
found
daughter
as
if
that
joy
were
now
become
a
loss
cries
o
thy
mother
thy
mother
then
asks
bohemia
forgiveness
then
embraces
his
soninlaw
then
again
worries
he
his
daughter
with
clipping
her
now
he
thanks
the
old
shepherd
which
stands
by
like
a
weatherbitten
conduit
of
many
kings
reigns
i
never
heard
of
such
another
encounter
which
lames
report
to
follow
it
and
undoes
description
to
do
it
second
gentleman
what
pray
you
became
of
antigonus
that
carried
hence
the
child
third
gentleman
like
an
old
tale
still
which
will
have
matter
to
rehearse
though
credit
be
asleep
and
not
an
ear
open
he
was
torn
to
pieces
with
a
bear
this
avouches
the
shepherds
son
who
has
not
only
his
innocence
which
seems
much
to
justify
him
but
a
handkerchief
and
rings
of
his
that
paulina
knows
first
gentleman
what
became
of
his
bark
and
his
followers
third
gentleman
wreckd
the
same
instant
of
their
masters
death
and
in
the
view
of
the
shepherd
so
that
all
the
instruments
which
aided
to
expose
the
child
were
even
then
lost
when
it
was
found
but
o
the
noble
combat
that
twixt
joy
and
sorrow
was
fought
in
paulina
she
had
one
eye
declind
for
the
loss
of
her
husband
another
elevated
that
the
oracle
was
fulfilld
she
lifted
the
princess
from
the
earth
and
so
locks
her
in
embracing
as
if
she
would
pin
her
to
her
heart
that
she
might
no
more
be
in
danger
of
losing
first
gentleman
the
dignity
of
this
act
was
worth
the
audience
of
kings
and
princes
for
by
such
was
it
acted
third
gentleman
one
of
the
prettiest
touches
of
all
and
that
which
angld
for
mine
eyes
caught
the
water
though
not
the
fish
was
when
at
the
relation
of
the
queens
death
with
the
manner
how
she
came
tot
bravely
confessd
and
lamented
by
the
king
how
attentivenes
wounded
his
daughter
till
from
one
sign
of
dolour
to
another
she
did
with
an
alas
i
would
fain
say
bleed
tears
for
i
am
sure
my
heart
wept
blood
who
was
most
marble
there
changed
colour
some
swooned
all
sorrowed
if
all
the
world
could
have
seent
the
woe
had
been
universal
first
gentleman
are
they
returned
to
the
court
third
gentleman
no
the
princess
hearing
of
her
mothers
statue
which
is
in
the
keeping
of
paulina
a
piece
many
years
in
doing
and
now
newly
performd
by
that
rare
italian
master
julio
romano
who
had
he
himself
eternity
and
could
put
breath
into
his
work
would
beguile
nature
of
her
custom
so
perfectly
he
is
her
ape
he
so
near
to
hermione
hath
done
hermione
that
they
say
one
would
speak
to
her
and
stand
in
hope
of
answer
thither
with
all
greediness
of
affection
are
they
gone
and
there
they
intend
to
sup
second
gentleman
i
thought
she
had
some
great
matter
there
in
hand
for
she
hath
privately
twice
or
thrice
a
day
ever
since
the
death
of
hermione
visited
that
removed
house
shall
we

and
with
our
company
piece
the
rejoicing
first
gentleman
who
would
be
thence
that
has
the
benefit
of
access
every
wink
of
an
eye
some
new
grace
will
be
born

us
unthrifty

our
knowledge

florizel
perdita
camillo
paulina
lords
and
attendants

leontes
o
grave
and
good
paulina
the
great
comfort
that
i
have
had
of
thee
paulina
what
sovereign
sir
i
did
not
well
i
meant
well
all
my
services
you
have
paid
home
but
that
you
have
vouchsafd
with
your
crownd
brother
and
these
your
contracted
heirs
of
your
kingdoms
my
poor
house
to
visit
it
is
a
surplus
of
your
grace
which
never
my
life
may
last
to
answer
leontes
o
paulina
we
honour
you
with
trouble
but
we
came
to
see
the
statue
of
our
queen
your
gallery
have
we
passd
through
not
without
much
content
in
many
singularities
but
we
saw
not
that
which
my
daughter
came
to
look
upon
the
statue
of
her
mother
paulina
as
she
livd
peerless
so
her
dead
likeness
i
do
well
believe
excels
whatever
yet
you
lookd
upon
or
hand
of
man
hath
done
therefore
i
keep
it
lonely
apart
but
here
it
is
prepare
to
see
the
life
as
lively
mockd
as
ever
still
sleep
mockd
death
behold
and
say
tis
well
paulina
draws
a
curtain
and
discovers
hermione
standing
like
a
statue
i
like
your
silence
it
the
more
shows
off
your
wonder
but
yet
speak
first
you
my
liege
comes
it
not
something
near
leontes
her
natural
posture
chide
me
dear
stone
that
i
may
say
indeed
thou
art
hermione
or
rather
thou
art
she
in
thy
not
chiding
for
she
was
as
tender
as
infancy
and
grace
but
yet
paulina
hermione
was
not
so
much
wrinkled
nothing
so
aged
as
this
seems
polixenes
o
not
by
much
paulina
so
much
the
more
our
carvers
excellence
which
lets
go
by
some
sixteen
years
and
makes
her
as
she
livd
now
leontes
as
now
she
might
have
done
so
much
to
my
good
comfort
as
it
is
now
piercing
to
my
soul
o
thus
she
stood
even
with
such
life
of
majesty
warm
life
as
now
it
coldly
stands
when
first
i
wood
her
i
am
ashamd
does
not
the
stone
rebuke
me
for
being
more
stone
than
it
o
royal
piece
theres
magic
in
thy
majesty
which
has
my
evils
conjurd
to
remembrance
and
from
thy
admiring
daughter
took
the
spirits
standing
like
stone
with
thee
perdita
and
give
me
leave
and
do
not
say
tis
superstition
that
i
kneel
and
then
implore
her
blessing
lady
dear
queen
that
ended
when
i
but
began
give
me
that
hand
of
yours
to
kiss
paulina
o
patience
the
statue
is
but
newly
fixd
the
colours
not
dry
camillo
my
lord
your
sorrow
was
too
sore
laid
on
which
sixteen
winters
cannot
blow
away
so
many
summers
dry
scarce
any
joy
did
ever
so
long
live
no
sorrow
but
killd
itself
much
sooner
polixenes
dear
my
brother
let
him
that
was
the
cause
of
this
have
powr
to
take
off
so
much
grief
from
you
as
he
will
piece
up
in
himself
paulina
indeed
my
lord
if
i
had
thought
the
sight
of
my
poor
image
would
thus
have
wrought
you
for
the
stone
is
mine
id
not
have
showd
it
leontes
do
not
draw
the
curtain
paulina
no
longer
shall
you
gaze
ont
lest
your
fancy
may
think
anon
it
moves
leontes
let
be
let
be
would
i
were
dead
but
that
methinks
already
what
was
he
that
did
make
it
see
my
lord
would
you
not
deem
it
breathd
and
that
those
veins
did
verily
bear
blood
polixenes
masterly
done
the
very
life
seems
warm
upon
her
lip
leontes
the
fixture
of
her
eye
has
motion
int
as
we
are
mockd
with
art
paulina
ill
draw
the
curtain
my
lords
almost
so
far
transported
that
hell
think
anon
it
lives
leontes
o
sweet
paulina
make
me
to
think
so
twenty
years
together
no
settled
senses
of
the
world
can
match
the
pleasure
of
that
madness
let
t
alone
paulina
i
am
sorry
sir
i
have
thus
far
stirrd
you
but
i
could
afflict
you
farther
leontes
do
paulina
for
this
affliction
has
a
taste
as
sweet
as
any
cordial
comfort
still
methinks
there
is
an
air
comes
from
her
what
fine
chisel
could
ever
yet
cut
breath
let
no
man
mock
me
for
i
will
kiss
her
paulina
good
my
lord
forbear
the
ruddiness
upon
her
lip
is
wet
youll
mar
it
if
you
kiss
it
stain
your
own
with
oily
painting
shall
i
draw
the
curtain
leontes
no
not
these
twenty
years
perdita
so
long
could
i
stand
by
a
lookeron
paulina
either
forbear
quit
presently
the
chapel
or
resolve
you
for
more
amazement
if
you
can
behold
it
ill
make
the
statue
move
indeed
descend
and
take
you
by
the
hand
but
then
youll
think
which
i
protest
against
i
am
assisted
by
wicked
powers
leontes
what
you
can
make
her
do
i
am
content
to
look
on
what
to
speak
i
am
content
to
hear
for
tis
as
easy
to
make
her
speak
as
move
paulina
it
is
requird
you
do
awake
your
faith
then
all
stand
still
or
those
that
think
it
is
unlawful
business
i
am
about
let
them
depart

no
foot
shall
stir
paulina

a
lovers
complaint

by
william
shakespeare



from
off
a
hill
whose
concave
womb
reworded
a
plaintful
story
from
a
sistring
vale
my
spirits
tattend
this
double
voice
accorded
and
down
i
laid
to
list
the
sadtuned
tale
ere
long
espied
a
fickle
maid
full
pale
tearing
of
papers
breaking
rings
atwain
storming
her
world
with
sorrows
wind
and
rain

upon
her
head
a
platted
hive
of
straw
which
fortified
her
visage
from
the
sun
whereon
the
thought
might
think
sometime
it
saw
the
carcase
of
a
beauty
spent
and
done
time
had
not
scythed
all
that
youth
begun
nor
youth
all
quit
but
spite
of
heavens
fell
rage
some
beauty
peeped
through
lattice
of
seared
age

oft
did
she
heave
her
napkin
to
her
eyne
which
on
it
had
conceited
characters
laundring
the
silken
figures
in
the
brine
that
seasoned
woe
had
pelleted
in
tears
and
often
reading
what
contents
it
bears
as
often
shrieking
undistinguished
woe
in
clamours
of
all
size
both
high
and
low

sometimes
her
levelled
eyes
their
carriage
ride
as
they
did
battry
to
the
spheres
intend
sometime
diverted
their
poor
balls
are
tied
to
th
orbed
earth
sometimes
they
do
extend
their
view
right
on
anon
their
gazes
lend
to
every
place
at
once
and
nowhere
fixed
the
mind
and
sight
distractedly
commixed

her
hair
nor
loose
nor
tied
in
formal
plat
proclaimed
in
her
a
careless
hand
of
pride
for
some
untucked
descended
her
sheaved
hat
hanging
her
pale
and
pined
cheek
beside
some
in
her
threaden
fillet
still
did
bide
and
true
to
bondage
would
not
break
from
thence
though
slackly
braided
in
loose
negligence

a
thousand
favours
from
a
maund
she
drew
of
amber
crystal
and
of
beaded
jet
which
one
by
one
she
in
a
river
threw
upon
whose
weeping
margent
she
was
set
like
usury
applying
wet
to
wet
or
monarchs
hands
that
lets
not
bounty
fall
where
want
cries
some
but
where
excess
begs
all

of
folded
schedules
had
she
many
a
one
which
she
perused
sighed
tore
and
gave
the
flood
cracked
many
a
ring
of
posied
gold
and
bone
bidding
them
find
their
sepulchres
in
mud
found
yet
moe
letters
sadly
penned
in
blood
with
sleided
silk
feat
and
affectedly
enswathed
and
sealed
to
curious
secrecy

these
often
bathed
she
in
her
fluxive
eyes
and
often
kissed
and
often
gan
to
tear
cried
o
false
blood
thou
register
of
lies
what
unapproved
witness
dost
thou
bear
ink
would
have
seemed
more
black
and
damned
here
this
said
in
top
of
rage
the
lines
she
rents
big
discontents
so
breaking
their
contents

a
reverend
man
that
grazed
his
cattle
nigh
sometime
a
blusterer
that
the
ruffle
knew
of
court
of
city
and
had
let
go
by
the
swiftest
hours
observed
as
they
flew
towards
this
afflicted
fancy
fastly
drew
and
privileged
by
age
desires
to
know
in
brief
the
grounds
and
motives
of
her
woe

so
slides
he
down
upon
his
grained
bat
and
comely
distant
sits
he
by
her
side
when
he
again
desires
her
being
sat
her
grievance
with
his
hearing
to
divide
if
that
from
him
there
may
be
aught
applied
which
may
her
suffering
ecstasy
assuage
tis
promised
in
the
charity
of
age

father
she
says
though
in
me
you
behold
the
injury
of
many
a
blasting
hour
let
it
not
tell
your
judgement
i
am
old
not
age
but
sorrow
over
me
hath
power
i
might
as
yet
have
been
a
spreading
flower
fresh
to
myself
if
i
had
selfapplied
love
to
myself
and
to
no
love
beside

but
woe
is
me
too
early
i
attended
a
youthful
suit
it
was
to
gain
my
grace
o
one
by
natures
outwards
so
commended
that
maidens
eyes
stuck
over
all
his
face
love
lacked
a
dwelling
and
made
him
her
place
and
when
in
his
fair
parts
she
did
abide
she
was
new
lodged
and
newly
deified

his
browny
locks
did
hang
in
crooked
curls
and
every
light
occasion
of
the
wind
upon
his
lips
their
silken
parcels
hurls
whats
sweet
to
do
to
do
will
aptly
find
each
eye
that
saw
him
did
enchant
the
mind
for
on
his
visage
was
in
little
drawn
what
largeness
thinks
in
paradise
was
sawn

small
show
of
man
was
yet
upon
his
chin
his
phoenix
down
began
but
to
appear
like
unshorn
velvet
on
that
termless
skin
whose
bare
outbragged
the
web
it
seemed
to
wear
yet
showed
his
visage
by
that
cost
more
dear
and
nice
affections
wavering
stood
in
doubt
if
best
were
as
it
was
or
best
without

his
qualities
were
beauteous
as
his
form
for
maidentongued
he
was
and
thereof
free
yet
if
men
moved
him
was
he
such
a
storm
as
oft
twixt
may
and
april
is
to
see
when
winds
breathe
sweet
unruly
though
they
be
his
rudeness
so
with
his
authorized
youth
did
livery
falseness
in
a
pride
of
truth

well
could
he
ride
and
often
men
would
say
that
horse
his
mettle
from
his
rider
takes
proud
of
subjection
noble
by
the
sway
what
rounds
what
bounds
what
course
what
stop
he
makes
and
controversy
hence
a
question
takes
whether
the
horse
by
him
became
his
deed
or
he
his
manage
by
th
welldoing
steed

but
quickly
on
this
side
the
verdict
went
his
real
habitude
gave
life
and
grace
to
appertainings
and
to
ornament
accomplished
in
himself
not
in
his
case
all
aids
themselves
made
fairer
by
their
place
came
for
additions
yet
their
purposed
trim
pierced
not
his
grace
but
were
all
graced
by
him

so
on
the
tip
of
his
subduing
tongue
all
kind
of
arguments
and
question
deep
all
replication
prompt
and
reason
strong
for
his
advantage
still
did
wake
and
sleep
to
make
the
weeper
laugh
the
laugher
weep
he
had
the
dialect
and
different
skill
catching
all
passions
in
his
craft
of
will

that
he
did
in
the
general
bosom
reign
of
young
of
old
and
sexes
both
enchanted
to
dwell
with
him
in
thoughts
or
to
remain
in
personal
duty
following
where
he
haunted
consents
bewitched
ere
he
desire
have
granted
and
dialogued
for
him
what
he
would
say
asked
their
own
wills
and
made
their
wills
obey

many
there
were
that
did
his
picture
get
to
serve
their
eyes
and
in
it
put
their
mind
like
fools
that
in
th
imagination
set
the
goodly
objects
which
abroad
they
find
of
lands
and
mansions
theirs
in
thought
assigned
and
labouring
in
moe
pleasures
to
bestow
them
than
the
true
gouty
landlord
which
doth
owe
them

so
many
have
that
never
touched
his
hand
sweetly
supposed
them
mistress
of
his
heart
my
woeful
self
that
did
in
freedom
stand
and
was
my
own
feesimple
not
in
part
what
with
his
art
in
youth
and
youth
in
art
threw
my
affections
in
his
charmed
power
reserved
the
stalk
and
gave
him
all
my
flower

yet
did
i
not
as
some
my
equals
did
demand
of
him
nor
being
desired
yielded
finding
myself
in
honour
so
forbid
with
safest
distance
i
mine
honour
shielded
experience
for
me
many
bulwarks
builded
of
proofs
newbleeding
which
remained
the
foil
of
this
false
jewel
and
his
amorous
spoil

but
ah
who
ever
shunned
by
precedent
the
destined
ill
she
must
herself
assay
or
forced
examples
gainst
her
own
content
to
put
the
bypast
perils
in
her
way
counsel
may
stop
awhile
what
will
not
stay
for
when
we
rage
advice
is
often
seen
by
blunting
us
to
make
our
wills
more
keen

nor
gives
it
satisfaction
to
our
blood
that
we
must
curb
it
upon
others
proof
to
be
forbod
the
sweets
that
seems
so
good
for
fear
of
harms
that

aloof
the
one
a

that

though

and

it
is
thy

for
further
i
could
say
this
mans
untrue
and
knew
the
patterns
of
his
foul
beguiling
heard
where
his
plants
in
others
orchards
grew
saw
how
deceits
were
gilded
in
his
smiling
knew
vows
were
ever
brokers
to
defiling
thought
characters
and
words
merely
but
art
and
bastards
of
his
foul
adulterate
heart

and
long
upon
these
terms
i
held
my
city
till
thus
he
gan
besiege
me
gentle
maid
have
of
my
suffering
youth
some
feeling
pity
and
be
not
of
my
holy
vows
afraid
thats
to
ye
sworn
to
none
was
ever
said
for
feasts
of
love
i
have
been
called
unto
till
now
did
neer
invite
nor
never
woo

all
my
offences
that
abroad
you
see
are
errors
of
the
blood
none
of
the
mind
love
made
them
not
with
acture
they
may
be
where
neither
party
is
nor
true
nor
kind
they
sought
their
shame
that
so
their
shame
did
find
and
so
much
less
of
shame
in
me
remains
by
how
much
of
me
their
reproach
contains

among
the
many
that
mine
eyes
have
seen
not
one
whose
flame
my
heart
so
much
as
warmed
or
my
affection
put
to
th
smallest
teen
or
any
of
my
leisures
ever
charmed
harm
have
i
done
to
them
but
neer
was
harmed
kept
hearts
in
liveries
but
mine
own
was
free
and
reigned
commanding
in
his
monarchy

look
here
what
tributes
wounded
fancies
sent
me
of
paled
pearls
and
rubies
red
as
blood
figuring
that
they
their
passions
likewise
lent
me
of
grief
and
blushes
aptly
understood
in
bloodless
white
and
the
encrimsoned
mood
effects
of
terror
and
dear
modesty
encamped
in
hearts
but
fighting
outwardly

and
lo
behold
these
talents
of
their
hair
with
twisted
metal
amorously
empleached
i
have
receivd
from
many
a
several
fair
their
kind
acceptance
weepingly
beseeched
with
the
annexions
of
fair
gems
enriched
and
deepbrained
sonnets
that
did
amplify
each
stones
dear
nature
worth
and
quality

the
diamond
why
twas
beautiful
and
hard
whereto
his
invised
properties
did
tend
the
deepgreen
emrald
in
whose
fresh
regard
weak
sights
their
sickly
radiance
do
amend
the
heavenhued
sapphire
and
the
opal
blend
with
objects
manifold
each
several
stone
with
wit
well
blazoned
smiled
or
made
some
moan

lo
all
these
trophies
of
affections
hot
of
pensived
and
subdued
desires
the
tender
nature
hath
charged
me
that
i
hoard
them
not
but
yield
them
up
where
i
myself
must
render
that
is
to
you
my
origin
and
ender
for
these
of
force
must
your
oblations
be
since
i
their
altar
you
enpatron
me

o
then
advance
of
yours
that
phraseless
hand
whose
white
weighs
down
the
airy
scale
of
praise
take
all
these
similes
to
your
own
command
hallowed
with
sighs
that
burning
lungs
did
raise
what
me
your
minister
for
you
obeys
works
under
you
and
to
your
audit
comes
their
distract
parcels
in
combined
sums

lo
this
device
was
sent
me
from
a
nun
or
sister
sanctified
of
holiest
note
which
late
her
noble
suit
in
court
did
shun
whose
rarest
havings
made
the
blossoms
dote
for
she
was
sought
by
spirits
of
richest
coat
but
kept
cold
distance
and
did
thence
remove
to
spend
her
living
in
eternal
love

but
o
my
sweet
what
labour
ist
to
leave
the
thing
we
have
not
mastring
what
not
strives
playing
the
place
which
did
no
form
receive
playing
patient
sports
in
unconstrained
gyves
she
that
her
fame
so
to
herself
contrives
the
scars
of
battle
scapeth
by
the
flight
and
makes
her
absence
valiant
not
her
might

o
pardon
me
in
that
my
boast
is
true
the
accident
which
brought
me
to
her
eye
upon
the
moment
did
her
force
subdue
and
now
she
would
the
caged
cloister
fly
religious
love
put
out
religions
eye
not
to
be
tempted
would
she
be
immured
and
now
to
tempt
all
liberty
procured

how
mighty
then
you
are
o
hear
me
tell
the
broken
bosoms
that
to
me
belong
have
emptied
all
their
fountains
in
my
well
and
mine
i
pour
your
ocean
all
among
i
strong
oer
them
and
you
oer
me
being
strong
must
for
your
victory
us
all
congest
as
compound
love
to
physic
your
cold
breast

my
parts
had
powr
to
charm
a
sacred
nun
who
disciplined
ay
dieted
in
grace
believed
her
eyes
when
they
tassail
begun
all
vows
and
consecrations
giving
place
o
most
potential
love
vow
bond
nor
space
in
thee
hath
neither
sting
knot
nor
confine
for
thou
art
all
and
all
things
else
are
thine

when
thou
impressest
what
are
precepts
worth
of
stale
example
when
thou
wilt
inflame
how
coldly
those
impediments
stand
forth
of
wealth
of
filial
fear
law
kindred
fame
loves
arms
are
peace
gainst
rule
gainst
sense
gainst
shame
and
sweetens
in
the
suffring
pangs
it
bears
the
aloes
of
all
forces
shocks
and
fears

now
all
these
hearts
that
do
on
mine
depend
feeling
it
break
with
bleeding
groans
they
pine
and
supplicant
their
sighs
to
your
extend
to
leave
the
battry
that
you
make
gainst
mine
lending
soft
audience
to
my
sweet
design
and
credent
soul
to
that
strongbonded
oath
that
shall
prefer
and
undertake
my
troth

this
said
his
watry
eyes
he
did
dismount
whose
sights
till
then
were
levelled
on
my
face
each
cheek
a
river
running
from
a
fount
with
brinish
current
downward
flowed
apace
o
how
the
channel
to
the
stream
gave
grace
who
glazed
with
crystal
gate
the
glowing
roses
that
flame
through
water
which
their
hue
encloses

o
father
what
a
hell
of
witchcraft
lies
in
the
small
orb
of
one
particular
tear
but
with
the
inundation
of
the
eyes
what
rocky
heart
to
water
will
not
wear
what
breast
so
cold
that
is
not
warmed
here
o
cleft
effect
cold
modesty
hot
wrath
both
fire
from
hence
and
chill
extincture
hath

for
lo
his
passion
but
an
art
of
craft
even
there
resolved
my
reason
into
tears
there
my
white
stole
of
chastity
i
daffed
shook
off
my
sober
guards
and
civil
fears
appear
to
him
as
he
to
me
appears
all
melting
though
our
drops
this
diffrence
bore
his
poisoned
me
and
mine
did
him
restore

in
him
a
plenitude
of
subtle
matter
applied
to
cautels
all
strange
forms
receives
of
burning
blushes
or
of
weeping
water
or
swooning
paleness
and
he
takes
and
leaves
in
eithers
aptness
as
it
best
deceives
to
blush
at
speeches
rank
to
weep
at
woes
or
to
turn
white
and
swoon
at
tragic
shows

that
not
a
heart
which
in
his
level
came
could
scape
the
hail
of
his
allhurting
aim
showing
fair
nature
is
both
kind
and
tame
and
veiled
in
them
did
win
whom
he
would
maim
against
the
thing
he
sought
he
would
exclaim
when
he
most
burned
in
heartwished
luxury
he
preached
pure
maid
and
praised
cold
chastity

thus
merely
with
the
garment
of
a
grace
the
naked
and
concealed
fiend
he
covered
that
th
unexperient
gave
the
tempter
place
which
like
a
cherubin
above
them
hovered
who
young
and
simple
would
not
be
so
lovered
ay
me
i
fell
and
yet
do
question
make
what
i
should
do
again
for
such
a
sake

o
that
infected
moisture
of
his
eye
o
that
false
fire
which
in
his
cheek
so
glowed
o
that
forced
thunder
from
his
heart
did
fly
o
that
sad
breath
his
spongy
lungs
bestowed
o
all
that
borrowed
motion
seeming
owed
would
yet
again
betray
the
forebetrayed
and
new
pervert
a
reconciled
maid
