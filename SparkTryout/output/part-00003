pursuit
had
he
been
taen
we
should
have
heard
the
news
had
he
been
slain
we
should
have
heard
the
news
or
had
he
scapd
methinks
we
should
have
heard
the
happy
tidings
of
his
good
escape
how
fares
my
brother
why
is
he
so
sad
richard
i
cannot
joy
until
i
be
resolvd
where
our
right
valiant
father
is
become
i
saw
him
in
the
battle
range
about
and
watchd
him
how
he
singled
clifford
forth
methought
he
bore
him
in
the
thickest
troop
as
doth
a
lion
in
a
herd
of
neat
or
as
a
bear
encompassd
round
with
dogs
who
having
pinchd
a
few
and
made
them
cry
the
rest
stand
all
aloof
and
bark
at
him
so
fard
our
father
with
his
enemies
so
fled
his
enemies
my
warlike
father
methinks
tis
prize
enough
to
be
his
son
see
how
the
morning
opes
her
golden
gates
and
takes
her
farewell
of
the
glorious
sun
how
well
resembles
it
the
prime
of
youth
trimmd
like
a
younker
prancing
to
his
love
edward
dazzle
mine
eyes
or
do
i
see
three
suns
richard
three
glorious
suns
each
one
a
perfect
sun
not
separated
with
the
racking
clouds
but
severd
in
a
pale
clearshining
sky
see
see
they
join
embrace
and
seem
to
kiss
as
if
they
vowd
some
league
inviolable
now
are
they
but
one
lamp
one
light
one
sun
in
this
the
heaven
figures
some
event
edward
tis
wondrous
strange
the
like
yet
never
heard
of
i
think
it
cites
us
brother
to
the
field
that
we
the
sons
of
brave
plantagenet
each
one
already
blazing
by
our
meeds
should
notwithstanding
join
our
lights
together
and
overshine
the
earth
as
this
the

bodes
henceforward

i
bear
upon

three
fair
shining

ah
one
that
was
a
woeful
lookeron
when
as
the
noble
duke

york
was
slain
your
princely
father
and
my
loving
lord
edward
o
speak

much
richard

how
he
died
for
i
will
hear
it
all
messenger
environed
he
was
with
many
foes
and
stood
against
them
as
the
hope
of
troy
against
the
greeks
that
would
have
entred
troy
but
hercules
himself
must
yield
to
odds
and
many
strokes
though
with
a
little
axe
hews
down
and
fells
the
hardesttimberd
oak
by
many
hands
your
father
was
subdud
but
only
slaughtred
by
the
ireful
arm
of
unrelenting
clifford
and
the
queen
who
crownd
the
gracious
duke
in
high
despite
laughd
in
his
face
and
when
with
grief
he
wept
the
ruthless
queen
gave
him
to
dry
his
cheeks
a
napkin
steeped
in
the
harmless
blood
of
sweet
young
rutland
by
rough
clifford
slain
and
after
many
scorns
many
foul
taunts
they
took
his
head
and
on
the
gates
of
york
they
set
the
same
and
there
it
doth
remain
the
saddest
spectacle
that
eer
i
viewd

our
baleful
news
and
at
each
words
deliverance
stab
poinards
in
our
flesh
till
all
were
told
the

o
valiant

the
duke
of

is
slain
edward
o
warwick
warwick
that
plantagenet
which
held
thee
dearly
as
his
souls
redemption
is
by
the
stern
lord
clifford
done
to
death
warwick
ten
days
ago
i
drownd
these
news
in
tears
and
now
to
add
more
measure
to
your
woes
i
come
to
tell
you
things
sith
then
befalln
after
the
bloody
fray
at
wakefield
fought
where
your
brave
father
breathd
his
latest
gasp
tidings
as
swiftly
as
the
posts
could
run
were
brought
me
of
your
loss
and
his
depart
i
then
in
london
keeper
of
the
king
musterd
my
soldiers
gathered
flocks
of
friends
and
very
well
appointed
as
i
thought
marchd
toward
saint
albans
to
intercept
the
queen
bearing
the
king
in
my
behalf
along
for
by
my
scouts
i
was
advertised
that
she
was
coming
with
a
full
intent
to
dash
our
late
decree
in
parliament
touching
king
henrys
oath
and
your
succession
short
tale
to
make
we
at
saint
albans
met
our
battles
joind
and
both
sides
fiercely
fought
but
whether
twas
the
coldness
of
the
king
who
lookd
full
gently
on
his
warlike
queen
that
robbd
my
soldiers
of
their
heated
spleen
or
whether
twas
report
of
her
success
or
more
than
common
fear
of
cliffords
rigour
who
thunders
to
his
captives
blood
and
death
i
cannot
judge
but
to
conclude
with
truth
their
weapons
like
to
lightning
came
and
went
our
soldiers
like
the
nightowls
lazy
flight
or
like
an
idle
thresher
with
a
flail
fell
gently
down
as
if
they
struck
their
friends
i
cheerd
them
up
with
justice
of
our
cause
with
promise
of
high
pay
and
great
rewards
but
all
in
vain
they
had
no
heart
to
fight
and
we
in
them
no
hope
to
win
the
day
so
that
we
fled
the
king
unto
the
queen
lord
george
your
brother
norfolk
and
myself
in
haste
posthaste
are
come
to
join
with
you

we
heard
you
were
making
another
head
to
fight
again
edward
where
is
the
duke
of
norfolk
gentle
warwick
and
when
came
george
from
burgundy
to

six
miles

and
for
your

strong
right
hand
of
mine
can
pluck
the
diadem
from
faint
henrys

go
throw
away
our
coats
of
steel
and
wrap
our
bodies
in
black
mourninggowns
numbering
our
avemaries
with
our

or
shall

on
the
helmets
of
our

tell
our
devotion

arms

wrought
the
easymelting

like
wax
he
swore
consent
to
your
succession
his
oath
enrolled
in
the
parliament
and
now
to
london
all
the
crew
are
gone
to
frustrate
both
his
oath
and
what
beside
may
make
against
the
house
of
lancaster
their
power
i
think
is
thirty
thousand
strong
now
if
the
help
of
norfolk
and
myself
with
all
the
friends
that
thou
brave
earl
of

amongst
the
loving
welshmen

we
march
amain
and
once
again
bestride
our
foaming
steeds
and
once

faints

alarum
and
retreat
enter
edward
george
richard
montague
warwick
and
soldiers

edward
now
breathe
we
lords
good
fortune
bids
us
pause
and
smooth
the
frowns
of
war
with
peaceful
looks
some
troops
pursue
the
bloodyminded
queen
that
led
calm
henry
though
he
were
a
king
as
doth
a
sail
filld
with
a
fretting
gust
command
an
argosy
to
stern
the
waves
but
think
you
lords
that
clifford
fled
with
them
warwick
no
tis
impossible
he
should
escape
for
though
before
his
face
i
speak
the
words
your
brother
richard
markd
him
for
the
grave
and
wheresoer
he
is
hes
surely
dead
clifford
groans
and
dies
richard
whose
soul
is
that
which
takes
her
heavy
leave
a
deadly
groan
like
life
and
deaths
departing
see
who
it
is
edward
and
now
the
battles
ended
if
friend
or
foe
let
him
be
gently
used
richard
revoke
that
doom
of
mercy
for
tis
clifford
who
not
contented
that
he
loppd
the
branch
in
hewing
rutland
when
his
leaves
put
forth
but
set
his
murdring
knife
unto
the
root
from
whence
that
tender
spray
did
sweetly
spring
i
mean
our
princely
father
duke
of
york
warwick
from
off
the
gates
of
york
fetch
down
the
head
your
fathers
head
which
clifford
placed
there
instead
whereof
let
this
supply
the
room
measure
for
measure
must
be
answered
edward
bring
forth
that
fatal
screechowl
to
our
house
that
nothing
sung
but
death
to
us
and
ours
now
death
shall
stop
his
dismal
threatning
sound
and
his
illboding
tongue
no
more
shall
speak
warwick
i
think
his
understanding
is
bereft
speak
clifford
dost
thou
know
who
speaks
to
thee
dark
cloudy
death
oershades
his
beams
of
life
and
he
nor
sees
nor
hears
us
what
we
say
richard
o
would
he
did
and
so
perhaps
he
doth
tis
but
his
policy
to
counterfeit
because
he
would
avoid
such
bitter
taunts
which
in
the
time
of
death
he
gave
our
father
george
if
so
thou
thinkst
vex
him
with
eager
words
richard
clifford
ask
mercy
and
obtain
no
grace
edward
clifford
repent
in
bootless
penitence
warwick
clifford
devise
excuses
for
thy
faults
george
while
we
devise
fell
tortures
for
thy
faults
richard
thou
didst
love
york
and
i
am
son
to
york
edward
thou
pitiedst
rutland
i
will
pity
thee
george
wheres
captain
margaret
to
fence
you
now
warwick
they
mock
thee
clifford
swear
as
thou
wast
wont
richard
what
not
an
oath
nay
then
the
world
goes
hard
when
clifford
cannot
spare
his
friends
an
oath
i
know
by
that
hes
dead
and
by
my
soul
if
this
right
hand
would
buy
two
hours
life
that
i
in
all
despite
might
rail
at
him
this
hand
should
chop
it
off
and
with
the
issuing
blood
stifle
the
villain
whose
unstanched
thirst
york
and
young
rutland
could
not
satisfy
warwick
ay
but
hes
dead
off
with
the
traitors
head
and
rear
it
in
the
place
your
fathers
stands
and
now
to
london
with
triumphant
march
there
to
be
crowned
englands
royal
king
from
whence
shall
warwick
cut
the
sea
to
france
and
ask
the
lady
bona
for
thy
queen
so
shalt
thou
sinew
both
these
lands
together
and
having
france
thy
friend
thou
shalt
not
dread
the
scattred
foe
that
hopes
to
rise
again
for
though
they
cannot
greatly
sting
to
hurt
yet
look
to
have
them
buzz
to
offend
thine
ears
first
will
i
see
the
coronation
and
then
to
brittany
ill
cross
the
sea
to
effect
this
marriage
so
it
please
my
lord
edward
even
as
thou
wilt
sweet
warwick
let
it
be
for
in
thy
shoulder
do
i
build
my
seat
and
never
will
i
undertake
the
thing
wherein

and
consent

crown
is
calld
content
a
crown
it
is
that
seldom

well
if
you
be
a
king
crownd
with

your
crown
content

it
to
me
again
obeying
with
my
wind
when
i
do
blow
and
yielding
to
another
when
it
blows
commanded
always
by
the
greater
gust
such
is
the
lightness
of
you
common
men
but
do

break
your
oaths
for
of
that
sin
my

i
perceive
your
highness
aims
at
if

thee
plain
i
aim
to
lie
with
thee
lady
grey
to
tell
you
plain
i
had
rather
lie
in
prison
king
edward
why
then
thou
shalt
not
have
thy
husbands
lands
lady
grey
why
then
mine
honesty
shall
be
my
dower
for

that
loss
i
will
not
purchase
them
king
edward
therein
thou
wrongst
thy
children
mightily
lady
grey
herein
your
highness
wrongs
both
them
and
me

mighty
lord
this
merry
inclination
accords
not
with
the
sadness
of
my
suit
please
you
dismiss
me
either
with
ay
or
no
king
edward
ay
if
thou
wilt
say

dost
say
no
to
my
demand

grey
then
no
my
lord
my
suit
is
at
an
end
gloucester
the
widow
likes
him
not
she
knits
her
brows
clarence
he
is
the
bluntest
wooer
in
christendom
king
edward
aside
her
looks
doth
argue
her
replete
with
modesty
her
words
doth
show
her
wit
incomparable
all
her
perfections
challenge
sovereignty
one
way
or
other
she
is
for
a
king
and

be
ten

bones
and
all
that
from
his
loins
no
hopeful
branch
may
spring
to
cross
me
from
the
golden
time
i
look
for
and
yet
between
my
souls
desire
and
me
the
lustful
edwards
title
buried
is
clarence
henry
and
his
son
young
edward
and
all
the
unlookd
for
issue
of
their
bodies
to
take
their
rooms
ere
i
can
place
myself
a
cold
premeditation
for
my
purpose
why
then
i
do
but
dream
on
sovereignty
like
one
that
stands
upon
a
promontory
and
spies
a
faroff
shore
where
he
would
tread
wishing
his
foot
were
equal
with
his
eye
and
chides
the
sea
that
sunders
him
from
thence
saying
hell
lade
it
dry
to
have
his
way
so
do
i
wish
the
crown
being
so
far
off
and
so
i
chide
the
means
that
keeps
me
from
it
and
so
i
say
ill
cut
the
causes
off
flattering
me
with
impossibilities
my
eyes
too
quick
my
heart
oerweens
too
much
unless
my
hand
and
strength
could
equal
them
well
say
there
is
no
kingdom
then
for
richard
what
other
pleasure
can
the
world
afford
ill
make
my
heaven
in
a
ladys
lap
and
deck
my
body
in
gay
ornaments
and
witch
sweet
ladies
with
my
words
and
looks
o
miserable
thought
and
more
unlikely
than
to
accomplish
twenty
golden
crowns
why
love
forswore
me
in
my
mothers
womb
and
for
i
should
not
deal
in
her
soft
laws
she
did
corrupt
frail
nature
with
some
bribe
to
shrink
mine
arm
up
like
a
witherd
shrub
to
make
an
envious
mountain
on
my
back
where
sits
deformity
to
mock
my
body
to
shape
my
legs
of
an
unequal
size
to
disproportion
me
in
every
part
like
to
a
chaos
or
an
unlickd
bearwhelp
that
carries
no
impression
like
the
dam
and
am
i
then
a
man
to
be
belovd
o
monstrous
fault
to
harbour
such
a
thought
then
since
this
earth
affords
no
joy
to
me
but
to
command
to
check
to
oerbear
such
as
are
of
better
person
than
myself
ill
make
my
heaven
to
dream
upon
the
crown
and
whiles
i
live
t
account
this
world
but
hell
until
my
misshapd
trunk
that
bear
this
head
be
round
impaled
with
a
glorious
crown
and
yet
i
know
not
how
to
get
the
crown
for
many
lives
stand
between
me
and
home
and
i
like
one
lost
in
a
thorny
wood
that
rents
the
thorns
and
is
rent
with
the
thorns
seeking
a
way
and
straying
from
the
way
not
knowing
how
to
find
the
open
air
but
toiling
desperately
to
find
it
out
torment
myself
to
catch
the
english
crown
and
from
that
torment
i
will
free
myself
or
hew
my
way
out
with
a
bloody
axe
why
i
can
smile
and
murder
whiles
i
smile
and
cry
content
to
that
which
grieves
my
heart
and
wet
my
cheeks
with
artificial
tears
and
frame
my
face
to
all
occasions
ill
drown
more
sailors
than
the

shall
ill
slay
more
gazers
than

basilisk
ill
play
the

as
well
as

deceive
more

that
thou

no

king
of

and
learn
a
while
to
serve
where
kings
command
i
was
i
must
confess
great
albions
queen
in
former
golden
days
but
now
mischance
hath
trod
my

with
dishonour
laid

on

where
i
must
take
like
seat
unto
my

and
to
my
humble

lewis
why
say
fair
queen
whence
springs
this
deep
despair
queen
margaret
from
such
a
cause
as
fills
mine
eyes
with
tears
and
stops
my
tongue
while
heart
is
drownd
in
cares
lewis
whateer

still
like

and
sit
thee
by

and

thy
grief
it

be
easd
if

can
yield
relief
queen
margaret
those
gracious
words
revive
my
drooping
thoughts
and
give
my
tonguetied
sorrows
leave
to
speak
now
therefore
be
it
known
to
noble
lewis
that
henry
sole
possessor
of
my
love
is
of
a
king
become
a
banishd
man
and
forcd
to
live
in
scotland
a
forlorn
while
proud
ambitious
edward
duke
of
york
usurps
the
regal
title
and
the
seat
of
englands
trueanointed
lawful
king
this
is
the
cause
that
i
poor
margaret
with
this
my
son
prince
edward
henrys
heir
am
come
to
crave
thy
just
and
lawful
aid
and
if
thou
fail
us
all
our
hope
is
done
scotland
hath
will
to
help
but
cannot
help
our
people
and
our
peers
are
both
misled
our
treasure
seizd
our
soldiers
put
to
flight
and
as
thou
seest
ourselves
in
heavy
plight
lewis
renowned
queen
with
patience
calm
the
storm
while
we
bethink
a
means
to
break
it
off
queen
margaret
the
more
we
stay
the
stronger
grows
our
foe
lewis
the
more
i
stay
the
more
ill
succour
thee
queen
margaret
o
but
impatience
waiteth
on
true
sorrow
and
see
where
comes
the
breeder
of
my
sorrow

enter
warwick

lewis
whats
he
approacheth
boldly
to
our
presence
queen
margaret
our
earl
of
warwick
edwards
greatest
friend
lewis
welcome
brave
warwick
what
brings
thee
to
france
he
descends
she
ariseth
queen
margaret
ay
now
begins
a
second
storm
to
rise
for
this
is
he
that
moves
both
wind
and
tide
warwick
from
worthy
edward
king
of
albion
my
lord
and
sovereign
and
thy
vowed
friend
i
come
in
kindness
and
unfeigned
love
first
to
do
greetings
to
thy
royal
person
and
then
to
crave
a
league
of
amity
and
lastly
to
confirm
that
amity
with
nuptial
knot
if
thou
vouchsafe
to
grant
that
virtuous
lady
bona
thy
fair
sister
to
englands
king
in
lawful
marriage
queen
margaret
aside
if
that
go
forward
henrys
hope
is
done
warwick
to
bona
and
gracious
madam
in
our
kings
behalf
i
am
commanded
with
your
leave
and
favour
humbly
to
kiss
your
hand
and
with
my
tongue
to
tell
the
passion
of
my
sovereigns
heart
where
fame
late
entring
at
his
heedful
ears
hath
placd
thy
beautys
image
and
thy
virtue
queen
margaret
king
lewis
and
lady
bona
hear
me
speak
before
you
answer
warwick
his
demand
springs
not
from
edwards
wellmeant
honest
love
but
from
deceit
bred
by
necessity
for
how
can
tyrants
safely
govern
home
unless
abroad
they
purchase
great
alliance
to
prove
him
tyrant
this
reason
may
suffice
that
henry
liveth
still
but
were
he
dead
yet
here
prince
edward
stands
king
henrys
son
look
therefore
lewis
that
by
this
league
and
marriage
thou
draw
not
on
thy
danger
and
dishonour
for
though
usurpers
sway
the
rule
a
while
yet
heavns
are
just
and
time
suppresseth
wrongs
warwick
injurious
margaret
prince
of
wales
and
why
not
queen
warwick
because
thy
father
henry
did
usurp
and
thou
no
more
art
prince
than
she
is
queen
oxford
then
warwick
disannuls
great
john
of
gaunt
which
did
subdue
the
greatest
part
of
spain
and
after
john
of
gaunt
henry
the
fourth
whose
wisdom
was
a
mirror
to
the
wisest
and
after
that
wise
prince
henry
the
fifth
who
by
his
prowess
conquered
all
france
from
these
our
henry
lineally
descends
warwick
oxford
how
haps
it
in
this
smooth
discourse
you
told
not
how
henry
the
sixth
hath
lost
all
that
which
henry
the
fifth
had
gotten
methinks
these
peers
of
france
should
smile
at
that
but
for
the
rest
you
tell
a
pedigree
of
threescore
and
two
years
a
silly
time
to
make
prescription
for
a
kingdoms
worth
oxford
why
warwick
canst
thou
speak
against
thy
liege
whom
thou
obeyedst
thirty
and
six
years
and
not
betray
thy
treason
with
a
blush
warwick
can
oxford
that
did
ever
fence
the
right
now
buckler
falsehood
with
a
pedigree
for
shame
leave
henry
and
call
edward
king
oxford
call
him
my
king
by
whose
injurious
doom
my
elder
brother
the
lord
aubrey
vere
was
done
to
death
and
more
than
so
my
father
even
in
the
downfall
of
his
mellowd
years
when
nature
brought
him
to
the
door
of
death
no
warwick
no
while
life
upholds
this
arm
this
arm
upholds
the
house
of
lancaster
warwick
and
i
the
house
of
york
lewis
queen
margaret
prince
edward
and
oxford
vouchsafe
at
our
request
to
stand
aside
while
i
use
further
conference
with
warwick
they
stand
aloof
queen
margaret
heavens
grant
that
warwicks
words
bewitch
him
not
lewis
now
warwick
tell
me
even
upon
thy
conscience
is
edward
your
true
king
for
i
were
loath
to
link
with
him
that
were
not
lawful
chosen
warwick
thereon
i
pawn
my
credit
and
mine
honour
lewis
but
is
he
gracious
in
the
peoples
eye
warwick
the
more
that
henry
was
unfortunate
lewis
then
further
all
dissembling
set
aside
tell
me
for
truth
the
measure
of
his
love
unto
our
sister
bona
warwick
such
it
seems
as
may
beseem
a
monarch
like
himself
myself
have
often
heard
him
say
and
swear
that
this
his
love
was
an
eternal
plant
whereof
the
root
was
fixd
in
virtues
ground
the
leaves
and
fruit
maintaind
with
beautys
sun
exempt
from
envy
but
not
from
disdain
unless
the
lady
bona
quit
his
pain
lewis
now
sister
let
us
hear
your
firm
resolve
bona
your
grant
or
your
denial
shall
be
mine
to
warwick
yet
i
confess
that
often
ere
this
day
when
i
have
heard
your
kings
desert
recounted
mine
ear
hath
tempted
judgment
to
desire
lewis
then
warwick
thus
our
sister
shall
be
edwards
and
now
forthwith
shall
articles
be
drawn
touching
the
jointure
that
your
king
must
make
which
with
her
dowry
shall
be
counterpoisd
draw
near
queen
margaret
and
be
a
witness
that
bona
shall
be
wife
to
the
english
king
prince
of
wales
to
edward
but
not
to
the
english
king
queen
margaret
deceitful
warwick
it
was
thy
device
by
this
alliance
to
make
void
my
suit
before
thy
coming
lewis
was
henrys
friend
lewis
and
still
is
friend
to
him
and
margaret
but
if
your
title
to
the
crown
be
weak
as
may
appear
by
edwards
good
success
then
tis
but
reason
that
i
be
releasd
from
giving
aid
which
late
i
promised
yet
shall
you
have
all
kindness
at
my
hand
that
your
estate
requires
and
mine
can
yield
warwick
henry
now
lives
in
scotland
at
his
case
where
having
nothing
nothing
can
he
lose
and
as
for
you
yourself
our
quondam
queen
you
have
a
father
able
to
maintain
you
and

full
of
truth

and
montague

gloucester
now
tell
me
brother
clarence
what
think
you
of
this
new
marriage
with
the
lady
grey
hath
not
our
brother
made
a
worthy
choice
clarence
alas
you
know
tis
far
from
hence
to
france
how
could
he
stay
till
warwick
made
return
somerset
my
lords
forbear
this
talk
here
comes
the
king

flourish
enter
king
edward
attended
lady
grey
as
queen
pembroke
stafford
hastings
and
others
four
stand
on
one
side
and
four
on
the
other

gloucester
and
his
wellchosen
bride
clarence
i
mind
to
tell
him
plainly
what
i
think
king
edward
now
brother
of
clarence
how
like
you
our
choice
that
you
stand
pensive
as
half
malcontent
clarence
as
well
as
lewis
of
france
or
the
earl
of
warwick
which
are
so
weak
of
courage
and
in
judgment
that
theyll
take
no
offence
at
our
abuse
king
edward
suppose
they
take
offence
without
a
cause
they
are
but
lewis
and
warwick
i
am
edward
your
king
and
warwicks
and
must
have
my
will
gloucester
and
shall
have
your
will
because
our
king
yet
hasty
marriage
seldom
proveth
well
king
edward
yea
brother
richard
are
you
offended
too
gloucester
not
i
no
god
forbid
that
i
should
wish
them
severd
whom
god
hath
joind
together
ay
and
twere
pity
to
sunder
them
that
yoke
so
well
together
king
edward
setting
your
scorns
and
your
mislike
aside
tell
me
some
reason
why
the
lady
grey
should
not
become
my
wife
and
englands
queen
and
you
too
somerset
and
montague
speak
freely
what
you
think
clarence
then
this
is
mine
opinion
that
king
lewis
becomes
your
enemy
for
mocking
him
about
the
marriage
of
the
lady
bona
gloucester
and
warwick
doing
what
you
gave
in
charge
is
now
dishonoured
by
this
new
marriage
king
edward
what
if
both
lewis
and
warwick
be
appeasd
by
such
invention
as
i
can
devise
montague
yet
to
have
joind
with
france
in
such
alliance
would
more
have
strengthned
this
our
commonwealth
gainst
foreign
storms
than
any
homebred
marriage
hastings
why
knows
not
montague
that
of
itself
england
is
safe
if
true
within
itself
montague
but
the
safer
when
tis
backd
with
france
hastings
tis
better
using
france
than
trusting
france
let
us
be
backd
with
god
and
with
the
seas
which
he
hath
givn
for
fence
impregnable
and
with
their
helps
only
defend
ourselves
in
them
and
in
ourselves
our
safety
lies
clarence
for
this
one
speech
lord
hastings
well
deserves
to
have
the
heir
of
the
lord
hungerford
king
edward
ay
what
of
that
it
was
my
will
and
grant
and
for
this
once
my
will
shall
stand
for
law
gloucester
and
yet
methinks
your
grace
hath
not
done
well
to
give
the
heir
and
daughter
of
lord
scales
unto
the
brother
of
your
loving
bride
she
better
would
have
fitted
me
or
clarence
but
in
your
bride
you
bury
brotherhood
clarence
or
else
you
would
not
have
bestowd
the
heir
of
the
lord
bonville
on
your
new
wifes
son
and
leave
your
brothers
to
go
speed
elsewhere
king
edward
alas
poor
clarence
is
it
for
a
wife
that
thou
art
malcontent
i
will
provide
thee
clarence
in
choosing
for
yourself
you
showd
your
judgment
which
being
shallow
you
shall
give
me
leave
to
play
the
broker
in
mine
own
behalf
and
to
that
end
i
shortly
mind
to
leave
you
king
edward
leave
me
or
tarry
edward
will
be
king
and
not
be
tied
unto
his
brothers
will
queen
elizabeth
my
lords
before
it
pleasd
his
majesty
to
raise
my
state
to
title
of
a
queen
do
me
but
right
and
you
must
all
confess
that
i
was
not
ignoble
of
descent
and
meaner
than
myself
have
had
like
fortune
but
as
this
title
honours
me
and
mine
so
your
dislikes
to
whom
i
would
be
pleasing
doth
cloud
my
joys
with
danger
and
with
sorrow
king
edward
my
love
forbear
to
fawn
upon
their
frowns
what
danger
or
what
sorrow
can
befall
thee
so
long
as
edward
is
thy
constant
friend
and
their
true
sovereign
whom
they
must
obey
nay
whom
they
shall
obey
and
love
thee
too
unless
they
seek
for
hatred
at
my
hands
which
if
they
do
yet
will
i
keep
thee
safe
and
they
shall
feel
the
vengeance
of
my
wrath
gloucester
aside
i
hear
yet
say
not
much
but

the
more

as
henrys
late
presaging

their
wounds
my
mildness
hath
allayd
their
swelling
griefs
my
mercy
dried
their
waterflowing
tears
i
have
not
been
desirous
of
their
wealth
nor
much
oppressd
them
with
great
subsidies
nor
forward
of
revenge
though
they
much
errd
then
why
should
they
love
edward
more
than

no
exeter

what

down

stabs

i
that
have
neither
pity
love
nor

indeed
tis
true
that
henry
told
me
of
for
i
have
often
heard
my
mother
say
i
came
into
the
world
with
my
legs
forward
had
i
not
reason
think
ye
to
make
haste
and
seek
their
ruin
that
usurpd
our
right
the
midwife
wonderd
and
the
women
cried
o
jesus
bless
us
he
is
born
with
teeth
and
so
i
was
which
plainly
signified
that
i
should
snarl
and
bite
and
play
the
dog
then
since
the
heavens
have
shapd
my
body
so
let
hell
make
crookd
my

to

it
i

no

i
am
like
no

this

which
greybeards

be

another

clarence
beware
thou

me
from

ill

death
king
henry

noble
scenes
as
draw
the
eye
to
flow
we
now
present
those
that
can
pity
here
may
if
they
think
it
well
let
fall
a
tear
the
subject
will
deserve
it
such
as
give
their
money
out
of
hope
they
may
believe
may
here
find
truth
too
those
that
come
to
see
only
a
show
or
two
and
so
agree
the
play
may
pass
if
they
be
still
and
willing
ill
undertake
may
see
away
their
shilling
richly
in
two
short
hours
only
they
that
come
to
hear
a
merry
bawdy
play
a
noise
of
targets
or
to
see
a
fellow
in
a
long
motley
coat
guarded
with
yellow
will
be
deceivd
for
gentle
hearers
know
to
rank
our
chosen
truth
with
such
a
show
as
fool
and
fight
is
beside
forfeiting
our
own
brains
and
the
opinion
that
we
bring
to
make
that
only
true
we
now
intend
will
leave
us
never
an
understanding
friend
therefore
for
goodness
sake
and
as
you
are
known
the
first
and
happiest
hearers
of
the
town
be
sad
as
we
would
make
ye
think
ye
see
the
very
persons
of
our
noble
story
as
they
were
living
think
you
see
them
great
and
followd
with
the
general
throng
and
sweat
of
thousand
friends
then
in
a
moment
see
how
soon
this
mightiness
meets
misery
and
if
you
can
be
merry
then
ill
say
a
man
may
weep
upon
his
weddingday

buckingham
good
morrow
and
well
met
how
have
ye
done
since
last
we
saw
in
france
norfolk
i
thank
your
grace
healthful
and
ever
since
a
fresh
admirer
of
what
i
saw
there
buckingham
an
untimely
ague
stayd
me
a
prisoner
in
my
chamber
when
those
suns
of
glory
those
two
lights
of
men
met
in
the
vale
of
andren
norfolk
twixt
guynes
and
arde
i
was
then
present
saw
them
salute
on
horseback
beheld
them
when
they
lighted
how
they
clung
in
their
embracement
as
they
grew
together
which
had
they
what
four
thrond
ones
could
have
weighd
such
a
compounded
one
buckingham
all
the
whole
time
i
was
my
chambers
prisoner
norfolk
then
you
lost
the
view
of
earthly
glory
men
might
say
till
this
time
pomp
was
single
but
now
married
to
one
above
itself
each
following
day
became
the
next
days
master
till
the
last
made
former
wonders
its
today
the
french
all
clinquant
all
in
gold
like
heathen
gods
shone
down
the
english
and
tomorrow
they
made
britain
india
every
man
that
stood
showd
like
a
mine
their
dwarfish
pages
were
as
cherubins
an
gilt
the
madams
too
not
usd
to
toil
did
almost
sweat
to
bear
the
pride
upon
them
that
their
very
labour
was
to
them
as
a
painting
now
this
masque
was
cried
incomparable
and
th
ensuing
night
made
it
a
fool
and
beggar
the
two
kings
equal
in
lustre
were
now
best
now
worst
as
presence
did
present
them
him
in
eye
still
him
in
praise
and
being
present
both
twas
said
they
saw
but
one
and
no
discerner
durst
wag
his
tongue
in
censure
when
these
suns
for
so
they
phrase
emby
their
heralds
challengd
the
noble
spirits
to
arms
they
did
perform
beyond
thoughts
compass
that
former
fabulous
story
being
now
seen
possible
enough
got
credit
that
bevis
was
believd
buckingham
o
you
go
far
norfolk
as
i
belong
to
worship
and
affect
in
honour
honesty
the
tract
of
evrything
would
by
a
good
discourser
lose
some
life
which
actions
self
was
tongue
to
all
was
royal
to
the
disposing
of
it
nought
rebelld
order
gave
each
thing

the
office
did
distinctly
his
full
function
buckingham
who
did
guide
i
mean
who
set
the
body
and
the
limbs
of
this
great
sport
together
as
you
guess
norfolk
one
certes
that
promises
no
element
in
such
a
business
buckingham
i
pray
you
who
my
lord
norfolk
all
this
was
ordred
by
the
good
discretion
of
the
right
reverend
cardinal
of
york
buckingham
the
devil
speed
him
no
mans
pie
is
freed
from
his
ambitious
finger
what
had
he
to
do
in
these
fierce
vanities
i
wonder
that
such
a
keech
can
with
his
very
bulk
take
up
the
rays
o
th
beneficial
sun
and
keep
it
from
the
earth
norfolk
surely
sir
theres
in
him
stuff
that
puts
him
to
these
ends
for
being
not
proppd
by
ancestry
whose
grace
chalks
successors
their
way
nor
calld
upon
for
high
feats
done
to
th
crown
neither
allied
to
eminent
assistants
but
spiderlike
out
of
his
selfdrawing
web
a
gives
us
note
the
force
of
his
own
merit
makes
his
way
a
gift
that
heaven
gives
for
him
which
buys
a
place
next
to
the
king
abergavenny
i
cannot
tell
what
heaven
hath
given
himlet
some
graver
eye
pierce
into
that
but
i
can
see
his
pride
peep
through
each
part
of
him
whence
has
he
that
if
not
from
hell
the
devil
is
a
niggard
or
has
given
all
before
and
he
begins
a
new
hell
in
himself
buckingham
why
the
devil
upon
this
french
going
out
took
he
upon
him
without
the
privity
o
th
kingt
appoint
who
should
attend
on
him
he
makes
up
the
file
of
all
the
gentry
for
the
most
part
such
to
whom
as
great
a
charge
as
little
honour
he
meant
to
lay
upon
and
his
own
letter
the
honourable
board
of
council
out
must
fetch
him
in
he
papers
abergavenny
i
do
know
kinsmen
of
mine
three
at
the
least
that
have
by
this
so
sickend
their
estates
that
never
they
shall
abound
as
formerly
buckingham
o
many
have
broke
their
backs
with
laying
manors
on
em
for
this
great
journey
what
did
this
vanity
but
minister
communication
of
a
most
poor
issue
norfolk
grievingly
i
think
the
peace
between
the
french
and
us
not
values
the
cost
that
did
conclude
it
buckingham
every
man
after
the
hideous
storm
that
followd
was
a
thing
inspird
and
not
consulting
broke
into
a
general
prophecythat
this
tempest
dashing
the
garment
of
this
peace
aboded
the
sudden
breach
ont
norfolk
which
is
budded
out
for
france
hath
flawd
the
league
and
hath
attachd
our
merchants
goods
at
bordeaux
abergavenny
is
it
therefore
th
ambassador
is
silencd
norfolk
marry
ist
abergavenny
a
proper
tide
of
a
peace
and
purchasd
at
a
superfluous
rate
buckingham
why
all
this
business
our
reverend
cardinal
carried
norfolk
like
it
your
grace
the
state
takes
notice
of
the
private
difference
betwixt
you
and
the
cardinal
i
advise
you
and
take
it
from
a
heart
that
wishes
towards
you
honour
and
plenteous
safetythat
you
read
the
cardinals
malice
and
his
potency
together
to
consider
further
that
what
his
high
hatred
would
effect
wants
not
a
minister
in
his
power
you
know
his
nature
that
hes
revengeful
and
i
know
his
sword
hath
a
sharp
edgeits
long
andt
may
be
said
it
reaches
far
and
where
twill
not
extend
thither

wholesome

as
able
to

his

infecting

another
yea
reciprocally
only
to
show
his

as
well
in

as
here
at

suggests
the
king
our
master
to
this
last
costly
treaty
th
interview
that
swallowed
so
much
treasure
and
like
a
glass
did
break
i
th
wrenching
norfolk
faith
and
so
it
did
buckingham
pray
give
me
favour
sir
this
cunning
cardinal
the
articles
o
th
combination
drew
as
himself
pleasd
and
they
were
ratified
as
he
cried
thus
let
be
to
as
much
end
as
give
a
crutch
to
th
dead
but
our
countcardinal
has
done
this
and
tis
well
for
worthy
wolsey
who
cannot
err

did
it
now
this

as
i
take
it
is
a
kind

treason
charles
the
emperor
under
pretence
to
see
the
queen
his
aunt
for
twas
indeed
his
colour
but
he
came
to
whisper
wolseyhere
makes
visitation
his
fears
were
that
the
interview
betwixt
england
and
france
might
through
their
amity
breed
him
some
prejudice
for
from
this
league
peepd
harms
that
menacd

deals
with
our
cardinal
and
as
i
trow
which
i
do
well
for
i
am
sure
the

paid
ere
he
promisd
whereby
his
suit
was
granted
ere
it
was

when
the

was
made
and
pavd
with

thus
desird
that

to
alter

course
and
break
the

know

the

its
come

this

is
a

i
would
your

quick
consideration
for
there

no

business
king
by

this
is
against

and
for
me
i
have
no
further
gone
in
this
than
by
a
single
voice
and
that
not
passd

by
learned
approbation
of

he

brought
to

by
a
vain
prophecy
of
nicholas

what
was
that
henton
surveyor
sir
a
chartreux
friar
his
confessor
who
fed
him
every

with
words
of

king
how
knowst
thou
this
surveyor
not
long
before
your
highness
sped
to
france
the
duke
being
at
the
rose
within
the
parish
saint
lawrence
poultney
did
of
me
demand
what
was
the
speech
among
the
londoners
concerning
the
french
journey
i
replied
men
feard
the
french
would
prove
perfidious
to
the
kings
danger
presently
the
duke
said
twas
the
fear
indeed
and
that
he
doubted
twould
prove
the
verity
of
certain
words
spoke
by
a
holy
monk
that
oft
says
he
hath
sent
to
me
wishing
me
to
permit
john
de
la
car
my
chaplain
a
choice
hour
to
hear
from
him
a
matter
of
some
moment
whom
after
under
the
confessions
seal
he
solemnly
had
sworn
that
what
he
spoke
my
chaplain
to
no
creature
living
but
to
me
should
utter
with
demure
confidence
this
pausingly
ensud
neither
the
king
nors
heirs
tell
you
the
duke
shall
prosper
bid
him
strive
to
gain
the
love
o
th
commonalty
the

katharine

i

you

you
were

i
told
my
lord
the

by

dangerous

ceremony
of

i
second
gentleman

what
second
gentleman
is

first
gentleman
yes

he
and
condemnd
upont
second
gentleman
i
am
sorry
fort
first
gentleman
so
are
a
number
more
second
gentleman
but
pray
how
passd
it
first
gentleman
ill
tell
you
in
a
little
the
great
duke
came
to
the
bar
where
to
his
accusations
he
pleaded
still
not
guilty
and
alleged
many
sharp
reasons
to
defeat
the
law
the
kings
attorney
on
the
contrary
urgd
on
the
examinations
proofs
confessions
of
divers
witnesses
which
the
duke
desird
to
have
brought
viva
voce
to
his
face
at
which
appeard
against
him
his
surveyor
sir
gilbert
peck
his
chancellor
and
john
car
confessor
to
him
with
that
devilmonk
hopkins
that
made
this
mischief
second
gentleman
that
was
he
that
fed
him
with
his
prophecies
first
gentleman
the
same
all
these
accusd
him
strongly
which
he
fain
would
have
flung
from
him
but
indeed
he
could
not
and
so
his
peers
upon
this
evidence
have
found
him
guilty
of
high
treason
much
he
spoke
and
learnedly
for
life
but
all
was
either
pitied
in
him
or
forgotten
second
gentleman
after
all
this
how
did
he
bear
himself
first
gentleman
when
he
was
brought
again
to
th
bar
to
hear
his
knell
rung
out
his
judgment
he
was
stirrd
with
such
an
agony
he
sweat
extremely
and
something
spoke
in
choler
ill
and
hasty
but
he
fell
to
himself
again
and
sweetly
in
all
the
rest
showd
a
most
noble
patience
second
gentleman
i
do
not
think
he
fears
death
first
gentleman
sure
he
does
not
he
never
was
so
womanish
the
cause
he
may
a
little
grieve
at
second
gentleman
certainly
the
cardinal
is
the
end
of
this
first
gentleman
tis
likely
by
all
conjectures
first
kildares
attainder
then
deputy
of
ireland
who
removd
earl
surrey
was
sent
thither
and
in
haste
too
lest
he
should
help
his
father
second
gentleman
that
trick
of
state
was
a
deep
envious
one
first
gentleman
at
his
return
no
doubt
he
will
requite
it
this
is
noted
and
generally
whoever
the
king
favours
the
cardinal
instantly
will
find
employment
and
far
enough
from
court
too
second
gentleman
all
the
commons
hate
him
perniciously
and
o
my
conscience
wish
him
ten
fathom
deep

much

it
and
with
that
blood
will
make
em
one
day
groan
fort
my
noble
father
henry
of
buckingham
who
first
raisd
head
against
usurping
richard
flying
for
succour
to
his
servant
banister
being
distressd
was
by
that
wretch
betrayd
and
without
trial
fell

seventh
succeeding

pitying
my
fathers
loss
like
a
most
royal
prince

to
my
honours
and
out
of
ruins
made
my
name
once
more
noble
now
his
son
henry
the
eighth
life
honour
name
and
all
that
made
me
happy
at
one
stroke
has
taken
for
ever
from
the
world
i
had
my
trial
and
must
needs
say
a
noble
one
which
makes
me
a
little
happier
than
my
wretched
father
yet
thus
far
we
are
one
in
fortunes
both
fell
by
our
servants
by
those
men
we
lovd
most
a
most
unnatural
and
faithless
service
heaven
has
an
end
in
all
yet
you
that
hear
me
this
from
a
dying
man
receive
as
certain
where
you
are
liberal
of
your
loves
and
counsels
be
sure
you
be
not
loose
for
those
you
make
friends
and
give
your
hearts
to
when
they
once
perceive
the
least
rub
in
your
fortunes
fall
away
like
water
from
ye
never
found
again
but
where
they
mean
to
sink
ye
all
good
people
pray
for
me
i
must
now
forsake
ye
the
last
hour
of
my
long
weary
life
is
come
upon
me
farewell
and
when
you
would
say
something
that
is
sad
speak
how
i
fell
i
have
done
and
god
forgive
me
exeunt
buckingham
and
train
first
gentleman
o
this
is
full
of
pity
sir
it
calls
i
fear
too
many
curses
on
their
heads
that
were
the
authors
second
gentleman
if
the
duke
be
guiltless
tis
full
of
woe
yet
i
can
give
you
inkling
of
an
ensuing
evil
if
it
fall
greater
than
this
first
gentleman
good
angels
keep
it
from
us
what
may
it
be
you
do
not
doubt
my
faith
sir
second
gentleman
this
secret
is
so
weighty
twill
require
a
strong
faith
to
conceal
it
first
gentleman
let
me
have
it
i
do
not
talk
much
second
gentleman
i
am
confident
you
shall
sir
did
you
not
of
late
days
hear
a
buzzing
of
a
separation
between
the
king
and
katharine
first
gentleman
yes
but
it
held
not
for
when
the
king
once
heard
it
out
of
anger
he
sent
command
to
the
lord
mayor
straight
to
stop
the
rumour
and
allay
those
tongues
that
durst
disperse
it
second
gentleman
but
that
slander
sir
is
found
a
truth
now
for
it
grows
again
fresher
than
eer
it
was
and
held
for
certain
the
king
will
venture
at
it
either
the
cardinal
or
some
about
him
near
have
out
of
malice
to
the
good
queen
possessd
him
with
a
scruple
that
will
undo
her
to
confirm
this
too
cardinal
campeius
is
arrivd
and
lately
as
all
think
for
this
business
first
gentleman
tis
the
cardinal
and
merely
to
revenge
him
on
the
emperor
for
not
bestowing
on
him
at
his
asking
the
archbishopric
of
toledo
this
is
purposd
second
gentleman
i
think
you
have
hit
the
mark
but
ist
not
cruel
that
she
should
feel
the
smart
of
this
the
cardinal
will
have
his
will
and
she
must
fall
first
gentleman
tis
woeful
we
are
too
open
here
to
argue
this
lets
think
in
private

i
do
profess
you
speak
not
like
yourself
who

and
of

justified
you

wishd
the
sleeping
of
this
business
never
desird
it
to
be
stirrd
but
oft
have
hindred
oft
the
passages
made
toward
it
on
my
honour
i
speak
my
good
lord
cardinal
to
this
point
and
thus
far
clear
him
now
what
movd
me
tot
i
will
be
bold
with
time
and
your
attention
then
mark
th
inducement
thus
it
camegive
heed
tot
my
conscience
first
receivd
a
tenderness
scruple
and
prick
on
certain
speeches
utterd
by
th
bishop
of
bayonne
then
french
ambassador
who
had
been
hither
sent
on
the
debating
a
marriage
twixt
the
duke
of
orleans
and
our
daughter
mary
i
th
progress
of
this
business
ere
a
determinate
resolution
he
i
mean
the
bishopdid
require
a
respite
wherein
he
might
the
king
his
lord
advertise
whether
our
daughter
were
legitimate
respecting
this
our
marriage
with
the
dowager
sometimes
our
brothers
wife
this
respite
shook
the
bosom
of
my
conscience
enterd
me
yea
with
a
splitting
power
and
made
to
tremble
the
region
of
my
breast
which
forcd
such
way
that
many
mazd
considerings
did
throng
and
pressd
in
with
this
caution
first
methought
i
stood
not
in
the
smile
of
heaven
who
had
commanded
nature
that
my
ladys
womb
if
it
conceivd
a
male
child
by
me
should
do
no
more
offices
of
life
tot
than
the
grave
does
to
the
dead
for
her
male
issue
or
died
where
they
were
made
or
shortly
after
this
world
had
aird
them
hence
i
took
a
thought
this
was
a
judgment
on
me
that
my
kingdom
well
worthy
the
best
heir
o
th
world
should
not
be
gladded
int
by
me
then
follows
that
i
weighd
the
danger
which
my
realms
stood
in
by
this
my
issues
fail
and
that
gave
to
me
many
a
groaning
throe
thus
hulling
in
the
wild
sea
of
my
conscience
i
did
steer
toward
this
remedy
whereupon
we
are
now
present
here
together
thats
to
say
i
meant
to
rectify
my
conscience
which
i
then
did
feel
full
sick
and
yet
not
well
by
all
the
reverend
fathers
of
the
land
and
doctors
learnd
first
i
began
in
private
with
you
my
lord
of
lincoln
you
remember
how
under
my
oppression
i
did
reek
when
i
first
movd
you
lincoln
very
well
my
liege
king
i
have
spoke
long
be
pleasd
yourself
to
say
how
far
you
satisfied
me
lincoln
so
please
your
highness
the
question
did
at
first
so
stagger
me
bearing
a
state
of
mighty
moment
int
and
consequence
of
dreadthat
i
committed
the
daringst
counsel
which
i
had
to
doubt
and
did
entreat
your
highness
to
this
course
which
you
are
running
here
king
i
then
movd
you
my
lord
of
canterbury
and
got
your
leave
to
make
this
present
summons
unsolicited
i
left
no
reverend
person
in
this
court
but
by
particular
consent
proceeded
under
your
hands
and
seals
therefore
go
on
for
no
dislike
i
th
world
against
the
person
of
the
good
queen
but
the
sharp
thorny
points
of
my
alleged
reasons
drives
this
forward
prove
but
our
marriage
lawful
by
my
life
and
kingly
dignity
we
are
contented
to
wear
our
moral
state
to
come
with
her
katharine
our
queen
before
the
primest
creature
thats
paragond
o
th
world
campeius
so
please
your
highness
the
queen
being
absent
tis
a
needful
fitness
that
we
adjourn
this
court
till
further
day
meanwhile
must
be
an
earnest
motion
made
to
the
queen
to
call
back
her
appeal
she
intends
unto
his
holiness
king

aside

i
may
perceive
these
cardinals
trifle
with
me
i
abhor
this
dilatory
sloth
and
tricks
of
rome
my
learnd
and
wellbeloved
servant

would
wish
mine
enemy
surrey
how
came
his
practices
to
light
suffolk
most
strangely
surrey
o
how
how
suffolk
the
cardinals
letters
to
the

miscarried
and
came
to
th

o
th
king
wherein
was
read
how
that
the

did
entreat
his
holiness
to
stay
the
judgment
o
th
divorce
for
if

i

quoth
he
perceive
my

is
tangled
in
affection
to
a

of

lady
anne
bullen
surrey
has
the

this
suffolk
believe

the

in

perceives
him
how
he
coasts

but
in

point
all
his

founder
and
he
brings
his

the

him
with
an
axe
wolsey
this
and
all
else
this
talking
lord
can
lay
upon
my
credit
i
answer
is
most
false
the
duke
by
law
found
his
deserts
how
innocent
i
was
from
any
private
malice
in
his
end
his
noble
jury
and
foul
cause
can
witness
if
i
lovd
many
words
lord
i
should
tell
you
you
have
as
little
honesty
as
honour
that
in
the
way
of
loyalty
and
truth
toward
the
king
my
ever
royal
master
dare
mate
a
sounder
man
than
surrey
can
be
and
an
that
love
his
follies
surrey
by
my
soul
your
long
coat
priest
protects
you
thou
shouldst
feel
my
sword
i
the
lifeblood
of
thee
else
my
lords
can
ye
endure
to
hear
this
arrogance
and
from
this
fellow
if
we
live
thus
tamely
to
be
thus
jaded
by
a
piece
of
scarlet
farewell
nobility
let
his
grace
go
forward
and
dare
us
with
his
cap
like
larks
wolsey
all
goodness
is
poison
to
thy
stomach
surrey
yes
that
goodness
of
gleaning
all
the
lands
wealth
into
one
into
your
own
hands
cardinal
by
extortion
the
goodness
of
your
intercepted
packets
you
writ
to
th
pope
against
the
king
your
goodness
since
you
provoke
me
shall
be
most
notorious
my
lord
of
norfolk
as
you
are
truly
noble
as
you
respect
the
common
good
the
state
of
our
despisd
nobility
our
issues
whom
if
he
live
will
scarce
be
gentlemen
produce
the
grand
sum
of
his
sins
the
articles
collected
from
his
life
ill
startle
you
worse
than
the
sacring
bell
when
the
brown
wench
lay
kissing
in
your
arms
lord
cardinal
wolsey
how
much
methinks
i
could
despise
this
man
but
that
i
am
bound
in
charity
against
it
norfolk
those
articles
my
lord
are
in
the
kings
hand
but
thus
much
they
are
foul
ones
wolsey
so
much
fairer
and
spotless
shall
mine
innocence
arise
when
the
king
knows
my
truth
surrey
this
cannot
save
you
i
thank
my
memory
i
yet
remember
some
of
these
articles
and
out
they
shall
now
if
you
can
blush
and
cry
guilty
cardinal
youll
show
a
little
honesty
wolsey
speak
on
sir
i
dare
your
worst
objections
if
i
blush
it
is
to
see
a
nobleman
want
manners
surrey
i
had
rather
want
those
than
my
head
have
at
you
first
that
without
the
kings
assent
or
knowledge
you
wrought
to
be
a
legate
by
which
power
you
maimd
the
jurisdiction
of
all
bishops
norfolk
then
that
in
all
you
writ
to
rome
or
else
to
foreign
princes
ego
et
rex
meus
was
still
inscribd
in
which
you
brought
the
king
to
be
your
servant
suffolk
then
that
without
the
knowledge
either
of
king
or
council
when
you
went
ambassador
to
the
emperor
you
made
bold
to
carry
into
flanders
the
great
seal
surrey
item
you
sent
a
large
commission
to
gregory
de
cassado
to
conclude
without
the
kings
will
or
the
states
allowance
a
league
between
his
highness
and
ferrara
suffolk
that
out
of
mere
ambition
you
have
causd
your
holy
hat
to
be
stampd
on
the
kings
coin
surrey
then
that
you
have
sent
innumerable
substance
by
what
means
got
i
leave
to
your
own
conscience
to
furnish
rome
and
to
prepare
the
ways
you
have
for
dignities
to
the
mere
undoing
of
all
the
kingdom
many
more
there
are
which
since
they
are
of
you
and
odious
i
will
not
taint
my
mouth
with
chamberlain
o
my
lord
press
not
a
falling
man
too
far
tis
virtue
his
faults
lie
open
to
the
laws
let
them
not
you
correct
him
my
heart
weeps
to
see
him
so
little
of
his
great
self
surrey
i
forgive
him
suffolk
lord
cardinal
the
kings
further
pleasure
is
because
all
those
things
you
have
done
of
late
by
your
power
legatine
within
this
kingdom
fall
into
th
compass
of
a
praemunire
that
therefore
such
a
writ
be
sued
against
you
to
forfeit
all
your
goods
lands
tenements
chattels
and
whatsoever
and
to
be
out
of
the
kings
protection
this
is
my
charge
norfolk
and
so
well
leave
you
to
your
meditations
how
to
live
better
for
your
stubborn
answer
about
the
giving
back
the
great
seal
to
us
the
king
shall
know
it
and
no
doubt
shall
thank
you
so
fare
you
well
my
little
good
lord
cardinal
exeunt
all
but
wolsey
wolsey
so
farewell
to
the
little
good
you
bear
me
farewell
a
long
farewell
to
all
my
greatness
this
is
the
state
of
man
today
he
puts
forth
the
tender
leaves
of
hopes
tomorrow
blossoms
and
bears
his
blushing
honours
thick
upon
him
the
third
day
comes
a
frost
a
killing
frost
and
when
he
thinks
good
easy
man
full
surely
his
greatness
is
aripening
nips
his
root
and
then
he
falls
as
i
do
i
have
venturd
like
little
wanton
boys
that
swim
on
bladders
this
many
summers
in
a
sea
of
glory
but
far
beyond
my
depth
my
highblown
pride
at
length
broke
under
me
and
now
has
left
me
weary
and
old
with
service
to
the
mercy
of
a
rude
stream
that
must
for
ever
hide
me
vain
pomp
and
glory
of
this
world
i
hate
ye
i
feel
my
heart
new
opend
o
how
wretched
is
that
poor
man
that
hangs
on
princes
favours
there
is
betwixt
that
smile
we
would
aspire
to
that
sweet
aspect
of
princes
and
their
ruin
more
pangs
and
fears
than
wars
or
women
have
and
when
he
falls
he
falls
like
lucifer
never
to
hope
again

enter
cromwell
standing
amazed

why
how
now
cromwell
cromwell
i
have
no
power

fortitude
of

than
my
weakhearted
enemies

the
heaviest
and
the
worst
is

sudden
but
hes
a
learned
man
may
he
continue
long
in
his
highness
favour
and
do
justice
for
truths
sake
and
his
conscience
that
his
bones
when
he
has
run
his
course
and
sleeps
in
blessings

have
a
tomb
of
orphans
tears
wept
on

usher
and

her
woman

griffith
how
does
your
grace
katharine
o
griffith
sick
to
death
my
legs
like
loaden
branches
bow
to
th
earth
willing
to
leave
their
burden
reach
a
chair
sonow
methinks
i
feel
a
little
ease
didst
thou
not
tell
me
griffith
as
thou
ledst
me
that
the
great
child
of
honour
cardinal
wolsey
was
dead
griffith
yes
madam
but
i
think
your
grace
out
of
the
pain
you
sufferd
gave
no
ear
tot
katharine
prithee
good
griffith
tell
me
how
he
died
if
well
he
steppd
before
me
happily
for
my
example
griffith
well
the
voice
goes
madam
for
after
the
stout
earl
northumberland
arrested
him
at
york
and
brought
him
forward
as
a
man
sorely
tainted
to
his
answer
he
fell
sick
suddenly
and
grew
so
ill
he
could
not
sit
his
mule
katharine
alas
poor
man
griffith
at
last
with
easy
roads
he
came
to
leicester
lodgd
in
the
abbey
where
the
reverend
abbot
with
all
his
covent
honourably
receivd
him
to
whom
he
gave
these
words
o
father
abbot
an
old
man
broken
with
the
storms
of
state
is
come
to
lay
his
weary
bones
among
ye
give
him
a
little
earth
for
charity
so
went
to
bed
where
eagerly
his
sickness
pursud
him
still
and
three
nights
after
this
about
the
hour
of
eightwhich
he
himself
foretold
should
be
his
lastfull
of
repentance
continual
meditations
tears
and
sorrows
he
gave
his
honours
to
the
world
again
his
blessed
part
to
heaven
and
slept
in
peace
katharine
so
may
he
rest
his
faults
lie
gently
on
him
yet
thus
far
griffith
give
me
leave
to
speak
him
and
yet
with
charity
he
was
a
man
of
an
unbounded
stomach
ever
ranking
himself
with
princes
one
that
by
suggestion
tied
all
the
kingdom
simony
was
fair
play
his
own
opinion
was
his
law
i
th
presence
he
would
say
untruths
and
be
ever
double
both
in
his
words
and
meaning
he
was
never
but
where
he
meant
to
ruin
pitiful
his
promises
were
as
he
then
was
mighty
but
his
performance
as
he
is
now
nothing
of
his
own
body
he
was
ill
and
gave
the
clergy
ill
example
griffith
noble
madam
mens
evil
manners
live
in
brass
their
virtues
we
write

may
it
please
your

to
hear
me
speak
his
good

katharine
yes
good
griffith
i
were
malicious
else
griffith
this
cardinal
though
from
an
humble
stock
undoubtedly
was
fashiond
to
much
honour
from
his
cradle
he
was
a
scholar
and
a
ripe
and
good
one
exceeding
wise
fairspoken
and
persuading
lofty
and
sour
to
them
that
lovd
him
not
but
to
those
men
that
sought
him
sweet
as
summer
and
though
he
were
unsatisfied
in
getting
which
was
a
sinyet
in
bestowing
madam
he
was
most
princely
ever
witness
for
him
those
twins
of
learning
that
he
raisd
in
you
ipswich
and
oxford
one
of
which
fell
with
him
unwilling
to
outlive
the
good
that
did
it
the
other
though
unfinishd
yet
so
famous
so
excellent
in
art
and
still
so
rising
that
christendom
shall
ever
speak
his
virtue
his
overthrow
heapd
happiness
upon
him
for
then
and
not
till
then
he
felt
himself
and
found
the
blessedness
of
being
little
and
to
add
greater
honours
to
his
age
than
man
could
give
him
he
died
fearing
god
katharine
after
my
death
i
wish
no
other
herald
no
other
speaker
of
my
living
actions
to
keep
mine

on

congee
unto

then
dance
and
at
certain
changes
the
first
two
hold
a
spare
garland
over
her
head
at
which
the
other
four
make
reverent
curtsies
then
the
two
that
held
the
garland
deliver
the
same
to
the
other
next
two
who
observe
the
same
order
in
their
changes
and
holding
the
garland
over
her
head
which
done
they
deliver
the
same
garland
to
the
last
two
who
likewise
observe
the
same
order
at
which
as
it
were
by
inspiration
she
makes
in
her
sleep
signs
of
rejoicing
and
holdeth
up
her
hands
to
heaven
and

in
their
dancing
vanish

and
behold
that
chair
stand
empty
but
we
all
are
men
in

few

frailty
and
want
of

have
misdemeand
yourself

so
we

new

divers
and
dangerous
which
are
heresies
and
not
reformd
may
prove
pernicious

which
reformation
must
be
sudden
too
my
noble
lords
for
those
that
tame
wild
horses
pace
em
not
in
their

to
make
em
gentle
but
stop
their
mouth
with
stubborn
bits
and
spur
em
till
they
obey
the
manage
if
we
suffer
out
of
our
easiness
and
childish
pity
to
one
mans
honour
this
contagious
sickness
farewell
all

and
what
follows
then
commotions
uproars
with
a
general

freshly
pitied
in

cranmer
my
good
lords
hitherto
in
all
the
progress
both
of
my
life
and
office
i
have
labourd
and
with
no
little
study
that
my
teaching
and
the
strong
course
of
my
authority
might
go
one
way
and
safely
and
the
end
was
ever
to
do
well
nor
is
there
living
i
speak
it
with
a
single
heart
my
lords
a
man
that
more
detests
more
stirs
against
both
in
his
private
conscience
and
his
place
defacers
of
a
public
peace
than
i
do
pray
heaven
the
king
may
never
find
a
heart
with
less
allegiance
in
it
men
that
make
envy
and
crooked
malice
nourishment
dare
bite
the
best
i
do
beseech
your
lordships
that
in
this
case
of
justice
my
accusers
be
what
they
will
may
stand
forth
face
to
face
and
freely
urge
against
me
suffolk
nay
my
lord
that
cannot
be
you
are
a
councillor
and
by
that
virtue
no
man
dare
accuse
you
gardiner
my
lord
because
we
have
business
of
more
moment
we
will
be
short
with
you
tis
his
highness
pleasure

being
but
a
private

provided
for

lay
all
the
weight
ye
can
upon

make
as
little
doubt

could
say
more
but
reverence
to
your
calling
makes
me
modest
gardiner
my
lord
my

a
sectary

the
plain
truth

to
men
that

you
words
and
weakness
cromwell
my
lord

winchester
yare
a
little
by
your
good

too
sharp
men
so
noble
however

a
cruelty
to
load
a
falling
man
gardiner
good

i
cry

worst
of

no

me
i
had
thought
i
had
had
men
of

but
i
find
none
was
it
discretion
lords

this
good
manfew
of

that
title
this
honest

wait

footboy
at

door
and
one
as
great
as
you
are
why
what
a
shame
was
this
did

far
forget
yourselves
i
gave

power
as
he
was
a
councillor
to
try
him
not
as
a
groom
theres
some
of
ye
i

malice
than

try
him
to
the
utmost
had
ye
mean
which
ye

tongue
excuse
all
what

purposd
concerning
his
imprisonment
was
rather
if
there
be
faith
in

certain

mother
mighty

from

five
hundred
pound
a
year

thine
inheritance
bastard
i
know
not
why
except
to
get
the
land
but
once
he
slanderd
me
with
bastardy
but
wheer
i
be
as
true
begot
or
no
that
still
i
lay
upon
my
mothers
head

that
i
am
as

begot
my
liege
fair

bones
that

pains
for

our
faces
and

if

father
and

son
like
him
o
old
sir
robert
father
on
my
knee

give

thanks

king

why
what
a
madcap
hath

elinor
he
hath
a
trick
of
coeurdelions
face
the
accent
of
his
tongue
affecteth
him
do
you
not
read
some
tokens
of
my
son
in
the
large
composition
of
this
man
king
john
mine
eye
hath
well
examined
his
parts
and
finds
them
perfect
richard
sirrah
speak
what
doth
move
you
to
claim
your
brothers
land
bastard
because
he
hath
a
halfface
like
my
father
with
half
that
face
would
he
have
all
my
land
a
halffacd
groat
five
hundred
pound
a
year
robert
my
gracious
liege
when
that
my
father
livd
your
brother
did
employ
my
father
much
bastard
well
sir
by
this
you
cannot
get
my
land
your
tale
must
be
how
he
employd
my
mother
robert
and
once
dispatchd
him
in
an
embassy
to
germany
there
with
the
emperor
to
treat
of
high
affairs
touching
that
time
th
advantage
of
his
absence
took
the
king
and
in
the
meantime
sojournd
at
my
fathers
where
how
he
did
prevail
i
shame
to
speak
but
truth
is
truth
large
lengths
of
seas
and
shores
between
my
father
and
my
mother
lay
as
i
have
heard
my
father
speak
himself
when
this
same
lusty
gentleman
was
got
upon
his
deathbed
he
by
will
bequeathd
his
lands
to
me
and
took
it
on
his
death
that
this
my
mothers
son
was
none
of
his
and
if
he
were
he
came
into
the
world
full
fourteen
weeks
before
the
course
of
time
then
good
my
liege
let
me
have
what
is
mine
my
fathers
land
as
was
my
fathers
will
king
john
sirrah
your
brother
is
legitimate
your
fathers
wife
did
after
wedlock
bear
him
and
if
she
did
play
false
the
fault
was
hers
which
fault
lies
on
the
hazards
of
all
husbands
that
marry
wives
tell
me
how
if
my
brother
who
as
you
say
took
pains
to
get
this
son
had
of
your
father
claimd
this
son
for
his
in
sooth
good
friend
your
father
might
have
kept
this
calf
bred
from
his
cow
from
all
the
world
in
sooth
he
might
then
if
he
were
my
brothers
my
brother
might
not
claim
him
nor
your
father
being
none
of
his
refuse
him
this
concludes
my
mothers
son
did
get
your
fathers
heir
your
fathers
heir
must
have
your
fathers
land
robert
shall
then
my
fathers
will
be
of
no
force
to
dispossess
that
child
which
is
not
his
bastard
of
no
more
force
to
dispossess
me
sir
than
was
his
will
to
get
me
as
i
think
elinor
whether
hadst
thou
rather
be
a
faulconbridge
and
like
thy
brother
to
enjoy
thy
land
or
the
reputed
son
of
coeurdelion
lord
of
thy
presence

no
land
beside

sir

like

two
such
ridingrods
my
arms
such
eelskins
stuffd
my

thin

in
mine

mighty

king
john
speak

we

citizen
that
daughter
there
of
spain
the
lady
blanch
is
niece
to
england
look
upon
the
years
of
lewis
the
dauphin
and
that
lovely
maid
if
lusty
love
should
go
in
quest
of
beauty
where
should
he
find
it
fairer
than
in
blanch
if
zealous
love
should
go
in
search
of
virtue
where
should
he
find
it
purer
than
in
blanch
if
love
ambitious
sought
a
match
of
birth
whose
veins
bound
richer
blood
than
lady
blanch
such
as
she
is
in
beauty
virtue
birth
is
the
young
dauphin
every
way
complete
if
not
complete
of
say
he
is
not
she
and
she
again
wants
nothing
to
name
want
if
want
it
be
not
that
she
is
not
he
he
is
the
half
part
of
a
blessed
man
left
to
be
finished
by
such
as
she
and
she
a
fair
divided
excellence
whose
fulness
of
perfection
lies
in
him
o
two
such
silver
currents
when
they
join
do
glorify
the
banks
that
bound
them
in
and
two
such
shores
to
two
such
streams
made
one
two
such
controlling
bounds
shall
you
be
kings
to
these
two
princes
if
you
marry
them
this
union
shall
do
more
than
battery
can
to
our
fastclosed
gates
for
at
this
match
with
swifter
spleen
than
powder
can
enforce
the
mouth
of
passage
shall
we
fling
wide
ope
and
give
you
entrance
but
without
this
match
the
sea
enraged
is
not
half
so
deaf
lions
more
confident
mountains
and
rocks
more
free
from
motionno
not
death
himself
in
mortal
fury
half
so
peremptory
as
we
to
keep
this
city
bastard
heres
a
stay
that
shakes
the
rotten
carcass
of
old
death
out
of
his
rags
heres
a
large
mouth
indeed
that
spits
forth
death
and
mountains
rocks
and
seas
talks
as
familiarly
of
roaring
lions
as
maids
of
thirteen
do
of
puppydogs
what
cannoneer
begot
this
lusty
blood
he
speaks
plain
cannonfire
and
smoke
and
bounce
he
gives
the
bastinado
with
his
tongue
our
ears
are
cudgelld
not
a
word
of
his
but
buffets
better
than
a
fist
of
france
zounds
i
was
never
so
bethumpd
with
words
since
i
first
calld
my
brothers
father
dad
elinor
son
list
to
this
conjunction
make
this
match
give
with
our
niece
a
dowry
large
enough
for
by
this
knot
thou
shalt
so
surely
tie
thy
now
unsurd
assurance
to
the
crown
that
yon
green
boy
shall
have
no
sun
to
ripe
the
bloom
that
promiseth
a
mighty
fruit
i
see
a
yielding
in
the
looks
of
france
mark
how
they
whisper
urge
them
while
their
souls
are
capable
of
this
ambition
lest
zeal
now
melted
by
the
windy
breath
of
soft
petitions
pity
and
remorse
cool
and
congeal
again
to
what
it
was
citizen
why
answer
not
the
double
majesties
this
friendly
treaty
of
our
threatned
town
king
philip
speak
england
first
that
hath
been
forward
first
to
speak
unto
this
city
what
say
you
king
john
if
that

there
thy
princely
son
can
in
this
book
of
beauty
read
i

weigh
equal
with
a
queen
for
anjou
and
fair
touraine
maine
poictiers
and
all
that
we
upon
this
side
the
sea
except
this
city
now
by
us
besiegd
find
liable
to
our
crown
and
dignity
shall
gild
her
bridal
bed
and
make
her
rich
in
titles
honours
and
promotions
as
she
in
beauty
education
blood
holds
hand
with
any
princess
of
the
world
king
philip
what
sayst
thou
boy
look
in
the
ladys
face
lewis
i
do
my
lord
and
in
her
eye
i
find
a
wonder
or
a
wondrous
miracle
the
shadow
of
myself
formd
in
her
eye
which
being
but
the
shadow
of
your
son
becomes
a
sun
and
makes
your
son
a
shadow
i
do
protest
i
never
lovd
myself
till
now
infixed
i
beheld
myself
drawn
in
the
flattering
table
of
her
eye
whispers
with
blanch
bastard

aside

drawn
in
the
flattering
table
of
her
eye
hangd
in
the
frowning
wrinkle
of
her
brow
and
quarterd
in
her
hearthe
doth
espy
himself
loves
traitor
this
is
pity
now
that
hangd
and
drawn
and
quarterd
there
should
be
in
such
a
love
so
vile
a
lout
as
he
blanch
my
uncles
will
in
this
respect
is
mine
if
he
see
aught
in
you
that
makes
him
like
that
anything
he
sees
which
moves
his
liking
i
can
with
ease
translate
it
to
my
will
or
if
you
will
to
speak
more
properly
i
will
enforce
it
easly
to
my
love
further
i
will
not
flatter
you
my
lord
that
all
i
see
in
you
is
worthy
love
than
this
that
nothing
do
i
see
in
you
though
churlish
thoughts
themselves
should
be
your
judge
that
i
can
find
should
merit
any
hate
king
john
what
say
these
young
ones
what
say
you
my
niece
blanch
that
she
is
bound
in
honour
still
to
do
what
you
in
wisdom
still
vouchsafe
to
say

sad
and
passionate
at
your
highness

my
faith

measure

and

brought
to
the

as

that
smoothfacd

tickling
commodity
commodity
the
bias
of
the
world
the
world
who
of
itself
is
peised
well
made
to
run
even
upon
even
ground
till
this
advantage
this
viledrawing
bias
this
sway
of
motion
this
commodity
makes
it
take
head
from
all
indifferency
from
all
direction
purpose
course
intent
and
this

bias
this
commodity
this
bawd
this
broker
this
allchanging
word
clappd
on
the
outward
eye
of
fickle
france
hath
drawn
him
from
his

determind
aid
from
a
resolvd

honourable
war
to
a
most
base
and
vileconcluded
peace
and
why

not
that
i
have
the

i
am
a

i
will
rail
and
say
there
is
no
sin

to
be
rich
and
being
rich
my
virtue
then
shall
be
to

there
is
no

here
comes
the
holy
legate
of
the
pope
pandulph
hail
you
anointed
deputies
of
heaven
to
thee
king
john
my
holy
errand
is
i
pandulph
of
fair
milan
cardinal
and
from
pope
innocent
the
legate
here
do
in
his
name
religiously
demand
why
thou
against
the
church
our
holy
mother
so
wilfully
dost
spurn
and
force
perforce
keep
stephen
langton
chosen
archbishop
of
canterbury
from
that
holy
see
this
in
our
foresaid
holy
fathers
name
pope
innocent
i
do
demand
of
thee
king
john
what
earthly
name
to
interrogatories
can
task
the
free
breath
of
a
sacred
king
thou
canst
not
cardinal
devise
a
name
so
slight
unworthy
and
ridiculous
to
charge
me
to
an
answer
as
the
pope
tell
him
this
tale
and
from
the
mouth
of
england
add
thus
much
more
that
no
italian
priest
shall
tithe
or
toll
in
our
dominions
but
as
we
under
heaven
are
supreme
head
so
under
him
that
great
supremacy
where
we
do
reign
we
will
alone
uphold
without
th
assistance
of
a
mortal
hand
so
tell
the
pope
all
reverence
set
apart
to
him
and
his
usurpd
authority
king
philip
brother
of
england
you
blaspheme
in
this
king
john
though
you
and
all
the
kings
of
christendom
are
led
so
grossly
by
this
meddling
priest
dreading
the
curse
that
money
may
buy
out
and
by
the
merit
of
vile
gold
dross
dust
purchase
corrupted
pardon
of
a
man
who
in
that
sale
sells
pardon
from
himself
though
you
and
all
the
rest
so
grossly
led
this
juggling
witchcraft
with
revenue
cherish
yet
i
alone
alone
do
me
oppose
against
the
pope
and
count
his
friends
my
foes
pandulph
then
by
the
lawful
power
that
i
have
thou
shalt
stand
cursd
and
excommunicate
and
blessed
shall
he
be
that
doth
revolt
from
his
allegiance
to
an
heretic
and
meritorious
shall
that
hand
be
calld
canonized
and
worshippd
as
a
saint
that
takes
away
by
any
secret
course
thy
hateful
life
constance
o
lawful
let
it
be
that
i
have
room
with
rome
to
curse
awhile
good
father
cardinal
cry
thou
amen
to
my
keen
curses
for
without
my
wrong
there
is
no
tongue
hath
power
to
curse
him
right
pandulph
theres
law
and
warrant
lady
for
my
curse
constance
and
for
mine
too
when
law
can
do
no
right
let
it
be
lawful
that
law
bar
no
wrong
law
cannot
give
my
child
his
kingdom
here
for
he
that
holds
his
kingdom
holds
the
law
therefore
since
law
itself
is
perfect
wrong
how
can
the
law
forbid
my
tongue
to
curse
pandulph
philip
of
france
on
peril
of
a
curse
let
go
the
hand
of
that
archheretic
and
raise
the
power
of
france
upon
his
head
unless
he
do
submit
himself
to
rome
elinor
lookst
thou
pale
france
do
not
let
go
thy
hand
constance
look
to
that

hell
lose
a
soul
austria
king

listen
to
the
cardinal
bastard

these
wrongs
because
bastard
your
breeches
best
may
carry
them
king
john
philip
what
sayst
thou
to
the
cardinal
constance
what
should
he
say
but
as
the
cardinal
lewis
bethink
you
father
for
the
difference
is
purchase
of
a
heavy
curse
from
rome
or
the
light
loss
of
england
for
a
friend
forgo
the
easier
blanch
thats
the
curse
of
rome
constance
o
lewis
stand
fast
the
devil
tempts
thee
here
in
likeness
of
a
new
untrimmed
bride
blanch
the
lady
constance
speaks
not
from
her
faith
but
from
her
need
constance
o
if
thou
grant
my
need
which
only
lives
but
by
the
death
of
faith
that
need
must
needs
infer
this
principle
that
faith
would
live
again
by
death
of
need
o
then
tread
down
my
need
and
faith
mounts
up
keep
my
need
up
and
faith
is
trodden
down
king
john
the
king
is
movd

constance
o
be
removd

more
in

hang
nothing
but
a
calfsskin
most
sweet
lout
king
philip
i
am
perplexd
and
know
not
what
to
say
pandulph
what
canst
thou
say
but
will
perplex
thee
more
if
thou
stand
excommunicate
and
cursd
king
philip
good
reverend
father
make
my
person
yours
and
tell
me
how
you
would
bestow
yourself
this
royal
hand
and
mine
are
newly
knit
and
the
conjunction
of
our
inward
souls
married
in
league
coupled
and
linkd
together
with
all
religious
strength
of
sacred
vows
the
latest
breath
that
gave
the
sound
of
words
was
deepsworn
faith
peace
amity
true
love
between
our
kingdoms
and
our
royal
selves
and
even
before
this
truce
but
new
before
no
longer
than
we
well
could
wash
our
hands
to
clap
this
royal
bargain
up
of
peace
heaven
knows
they
were
besmeard
and
overstaind
with
slaughters
pencil
where
revenge
did
paint
the
fearful
difference
of
incensed
kings
and
shall
these
hands
so
lately
purgd
of
blood
so
newly
joind
in
love
so
strong
in
both
unyoke
this
seizure
and
this
kind
regreet
play
fast
and
loose
with
faith
so
jest
with
heaven
make
such
unconstant
children
of
ourselves
as
now
again
to
snatch
our
palm
from
palm
unswear
faith
sworn
and
on
the
marriagebed
of
smiling
peace
to
march
a
bloody
host
and
make
a
riot
on
the
gentle
brow
of
true
sincerity
o
holy
sir
my
reverend
father
let
it
not
be
so
out
of
your
grace
devise
ordain
impose
some
gentle
order
and
then
we
shall
be
blest
to
do
your
pleasure
and
continue
friends
pandulph
all
form
is
formless
order
orderless
save
what
is
opposite
to
englands
love
therefore
to
arms
be
champion
of
our
church
or
let
the
church
our
mother
breathe
her
curse
a
mothers
curseon
her
revolting
son
france
thou
mayst
hold
a
serpent
by
the
tongue
a
chafed
lion
by
the
mortal
paw
a
fasting
tiger
safer
by
the
tooth
than
keep
in
peace
that
hand
which
thou
dost
hold
king
philip
i
may
disjoin
my
hand
but
not
my
faith
pandulph
so
makst
thou
faith
an
enemy
to
faith
and
like
a
civil
war
setst
oath
to
oath
thy
tongue
against
thy
tongue
o
let
thy
vow
first
made
to
heaven
first
be
to
heaven
performd
that
is
to
be
the
champion
of
our
church
what
since
thou
sworst
is
sworn
against
thyself
and
may
not
be
performed
by
thyself
for
that
which
thou
hast
sworn
to
do
amiss
is
not
amiss
when
it
is
truly
done
and
being
not
done
where
doing
tends
to
ill
the
truth
is
then
most
done
not
doing
it
the
better
act
of
purposes
mistook
is
to
mistake
again
though
indirect
yet
indirection
thereby
grows
direct
and
falsehood
cures
as
fire
cools
fire
within
the
scorched
veins
of
one
newburnd
it
is
religion
that
doth
make
vows
kept
but
thou
hast
sworn
against
religion
by
what
thou
swearst
against
the
thing
thou
swearst
and
makst
an
oath
the
surety
for
thy
truth
against
an
oath
the
truth
thou
art
unsure
to
swear
swears
only
not
to
be
forsworn
else
what
a
mockery
should
it
be
to
swear
but
thou
dost
swear
only
to
be
forsworn
and
most
forsworn
to
keep
what
thou
dost
swear
therefore
thy
later
vows
against
thy
first
is
in
thyself
rebellion
to
thyself
and
better
conquest
never
canst
thou
make
than
arm
thy
constant
and
thy
nobler
parts
against
these
giddy
loose
suggestions
upon
which
better
part
our
prayrs
come
in
if
thou
vouchsafe
them
but
if
not
then
know
the
peril
of
our
curses
fight
on
thee
so
heavy
as
thou
shalt
not
shake
them
off
but
in
despair
die
under
the
black
weight
austria

thou
possessed

melancholy
had
bakd
thy

made

and
put
my
eyeballs
in
thy
vaulty
brows
and
ring
these
fingers
with
thy

worms
and

and

no
i
will
not
having
breath
to
cry
o
that
my
tongue
were
in
the
thunders
mouth
then
with
a
passion
would
i
shake
the
world
and
rouse
from
sleep
that
fell
anatomy
which
cannot
hear
a
ladys
feeble
voice
which
scorns
a
modern
invocation
pandulph
lady
you
utter
madness
and
not
sorrow
constance
thou
art
not
holy
to
belie
me
so
i
am
not
mad
this
hair
i
tear
is
mine
my
name
is
constance
i
was
geffreys
wife
young
arthur
is
my
son
and
he
is
lost
i
am
not
madi
would
to
heaven
i
were
for
then
tis
like
i
should
forget
myself
o
if
i
could
what
grief
should
i
forget
preach
some
philosophy
to
make
me
mad
and
thou
shalt
be
canonizd
cardinal
for
being
not
mad
but
sensible
of
grief
my
reasonable
part
produces
reason
how
i
may
be
deliverd
of
these
woes
and
teaches
me
to
kill
or
hang
myself
if
i
were
mad
i
should
forget
my
son
or
madly
think
a
babe
of
clouts
were
he
i
am
not
mad
too
well
too
well
i
feel
the
different
plague
of
each
calamity
king
philip
bind
up
those
tresses
o
what
love
i
note
in
the
fair
multitude
of
those
her
hairs
where
but
by
a
chance
a
silver
drop
hath
falln
even
to
that
drop
ten
thousand
wiry
friends
do
glue
themselves
in
sociable
grief
like
true
inseparable
faithful
loves
sticking
together
in
calamity
constance
to
england
if
you
will
king
philip
bind
up
your
hairs
constance
yes
that
i
will
and
wherefore
will
i
do
it
i
tore
them
from
their
bonds
and
cried
aloud
o
that
these
hands
could
so
redeem
my
son
as
they
have
given
these
hairs
their
liberty
but
now
i
envy
at
their
liberty
and
will
again
commit
them
to
their
bonds
because
my
poor
child
is
a
prisoner
and
father
cardinal
i
have
heard
you
say
that
we
shall
see
and
know
our
friends
in
heaven
if
that
be
true
i
shall
see
my
boy
again
for
since
the
birth
of
cain
the
first
male
child
to
him
that
did
but
yesterday
suspire
there
was
not
such
a
gracious
creature
born
but
now
will
canker
sorrow
eat
my
bud
and
chase
the
native
beauty
from
his
cheek
and
he
will
look
as
hollow
as
a
ghost
as
dim
and
meagre
as
an
agues
fit
and
so
hell
die
and
rising
so
again
when
i
shall
meet
him
in
the
court
of
heaven
i
shall
not
know
him
therefore
never
never
must
i
behold
my
pretty
arthur
more
pandulph
you
hold
too
heinous
a
respect
of
grief
constance
he
talks
to
me
that
never
had
a
son
king
philip
you
are
as
fond
of
grief
as
of
your
child
constance
grief
fills
the
room
up
of
my
absent
child
lies
in
his
bed
walks
up
and
down
with
me
puts
on
his
pretty
looks
repeats
his
words
remembers
me
of
all
his
gracious
parts
stuffs
out
his
vacant
garments
with
his
form
then
have
i
reason
to
be
fond
of
grief
fare
you
well
had
you
such
a
loss
as
i
i
could
give
better
comfort
than
you
do
i
will
not
keep
this
form
upon
my
head
tearing
her
hair
when
there
is
such
disorder
in
my
wit
o
lord
my
boy
my
arthur
my
fair
son
my
life
my
joy
my
food
my
ail
the

my
widowcomfort
and
my
sorrows

exit
king
philip
i
fear
some
outrage
and
ill
follow
her








exit
lewis
theres
nothing
in
this
world
can
make
me
joy
life
is
as
tedious
as
a
twicetold
tale
vexing
the
dull
ear
of
a
drowsy
man
and
bitter
shame
hath
spoild
the
sweet
worlds
taste
that
it
yields
nought
but
shame
and
bitterness
pandulph
before
the
curing
of
a
strong
disease
even
in
the
instant
of
repair
and
health
the
fit
is
strongest
evils
that
take
leave
on
their
departure
most
of
all
show
evil
what
have
you
lost
by
losing
of
this
day
lewis
all
days
of
glory
joy
and
happiness
pandulph
if
you
had
won
it
certainly
you
had
no
no
when
fortune
means
to
men
most
good
she
looks
upon
them
with
a
threatning
eye
tis
strange
to
think
how
much
king
john
hath
lost
in
this
which
he
accounts
so
clearly
won
are
not
you
grievd
that
arthur
is
his
prisoner
lewis
as
heartily
as
he
is
glad
he
hath
him
pandulph
your
mind
is
all
as
youthful
as
your
blood
now
hear
me
speak
with
a
prophetic
spirit
for
even
the
breath
of
what
i
mean
to
speak
shall
blow
each
dust
each
straw
each
little
rub
out
of
the
path
which
shall
directly
lead
thy
foot
to
englands
throne
and
therefore
mark
john
hath
seizd
arthur
and
it
cannot
be
that
whiles
warm
life
plays
in
that
infants
veins
the
misplacd
john
should
entertain
an
hour
one
minute
nay
one
quiet
breath
of
rest
a
sceptre
snatchd
with
an
unruly
hand
must
be
boisterously
maintaind
as
gaind
and
he
that
stands
upon
a
slippry
place
makes
nice
of
no
vile
hold
to
stay
him
up
that
john
may
stand
then
arthur
needs
must
fall
so
be
it
for
it
cannot
be
but
so
lewis
but
what
shall
i
gain
by
young
arthurs
fall
pandulph
you
in
the
right
of
lady
blanch
your
wife
may
then
make
all
the
claim
that
arthur
did
lewis
and
lose
it
life
and
all
as
arthur
did
pandulph
how
green
you
are
and
fresh
in
this
old
world
john
lays
you
plots
the
times
conspire
with
you
for
he
that
steeps
his
safety
in
true
blood
shall
find
but
bloody
safety
and
untrue
this
act
so
evilly
borne
shall
cool
the
hearts
of
all
his
people
and
freeze
up
their
zeal
that
none
so
small
advantage
shall
step
forth
to
check
his
reign
but
they
will
cherish
it
no
natural
exhalation
in
the
sky
no
scope
of
nature
no
distemperd
day
no
common
wind
no
customed
event
but
they
will
pluck
away
his
natural
cause
and
call
them
meteors
prodigies
and
signs
abortives
presages
and
tongues
of
heaven
plainly
denouncing
vengeance
upon
john
lewis
may
be
he
will
not
touch
young
arthurs
life
but
hold
himself
safe
in
his
prisonment
pandulph
o
sir
when
he
shall
hear
of
your
approach
if
that
young
arthur
be
not
gone
already
even
at
that
news
he
dies
and
then
the
hearts
of
all
his
people
shall
revolt
from
him
and
kiss
the
lips
of
unacquainted
change
and
pick
strong
matter
of
revolt
and
wrath
out
of
the
bloody
fingers
ends
of
john
methinks
i
see
this
hurly
all
on
foot
and
o
what
better
matter
breeds
for
you
than
i
have
namd
the
bastard
faulconbridge
is
now
in
england
ransacking
the
church
offending
charity
if
but
a
dozen
french
were
there
in
arms
they
would
be
as
a
can
to
train
ten
thousand
english
to
their
side
or
as
a
little
snow
tumbled
about
anon
becomes
a
mountain
o
noble
dauphin
go
with
me
to
the
king
tis
wonderful
what
may
be
wrought
out
of
their
discontent
now
that
their
souls
are
topful
of
offence
for
england
go
i
will
whet
on
the
king
lewis
strong
reasons
makes
strong
actions
let
us
go
if
you
say
ay
the
king
will
not
say
no

hubert
good
morrow
little
prince
arthur
as
little
prince
having
so
great
a
tide
to
be
more
prince
as
may
be
you
are
sad
hubert
indeed
i
have
been
merrier
arthur
mercy
on
me
methinks
no
body
should
be
sad
but
i
yet
i
remember
when
i
was
in
france
young
gentlemen
would
be
as
sad
as
night
only
for
wantonness
by
my
christendom
so
i
were
out
of
prison
and
kept
sheep
i
should
be
as
merry
as
the
day
is
long
and
so
i
would
be
here
but
that
i
doubt
my
uncle
practises
more
harm
to
me
he
is
afraid
of
me
and
i
of
him
is
it
my
fault
that
i
was
geffreys
son
no
indeed
ist
not
and
i
would
to
heaven
i
were
your
son
so
you
would
love
me
hubert
hubert

aside

if
i
talk
to
him
with
his
innocent
prate
he
will
awake
my
mercy
which
lies
dead
therefore
i
will
be
sudden
and
dispatch
arthur
are
you
sick
hubert
you
look
pale
today
in
sooth
i
would
you
were
a
little
sick
that
i
might
sit
all
night
and
watch
with
you
i
warrant
i
love
you
more
than
you
do
me
hubert

aside

his
words
do
take
possession
of
my
bosom
read
here
young
arthur























showing
a
paper
aside

how
now
foolish
rheum
turning
dispiteous
torture
out
of
door
i
must
be
brief
lest
resolution
drop
out
at
mine
eyes
in
tender
womanish
tears
can
you
not
read
it
is
it
not
fair
writ
arthur
too
fairly
hubert
for
so
foul
effect
must
you
with
hot
irons
burn
out
both
mine
eyes
hubert
young
boy
i
must
arthur
and
will
you
hubert
and
i
will
arthur
have
you
the
heart
when
your
head
did
but
ache
i
knit
my
handkerchief
about
your
brows
the
best
i
had
a
princess
wrought
it
me
and
i
did
never
ask
it
you
again
and
with
my
hand
at
midnight
held
your
head
and
like
the
watchful
minutes
to
the
hour
still
and
anon
cheerd
up
the
heavy
time
saying
what
lack
you
and
where
lies
your
grief
or
what
good
love
may
i
perform
for
you
many
a
poor
mans
son
would
have
lyen
still
and
neer
have
spoke
a
loving
word
to
you
but
you
at
your
sick
service
had
a
prince
nay
you
may
think
my
love
was
crafty
love
and
call
it
cunning
do
an
if
you
will
if
heaven
be
pleasd
that
you
must
use
me
ill
why
then
you
must
will
you
put
out
mine
eyes
these
eyes
that
never
did
nor
never
shall
so
much
as
frown
on
you
hubert
i
have
sworn
to
do
it
and
with
hot
irons
must
i
burn
them
out
arthur
ah
none
but
in
this
iron
age
would
do
it
the
iron
of
itself
though
heat
redhot
approaching
near
these
eyes
would
drink
my
tears
and
quench
his
fiery
indignation
even
in
the
matter
of
mine
innocence
nay
after
that
consume
away
in
rust
but
for
containing
fire
to
harm
mine
eye

you
more
stubbornhard
than
hammerd
iron
an
if
an
angel

have
come
to
me
and

that

that

as
an
ancient

troublesome

at
a

unseasonable
salisbury
in
this
the
antique

wellnoted

much
disfigured

like
a

it

sick

when

strive
to
do
better
than

they
do
confound
their
skill
in
covetousness

oftentimes
excusing
of
a
fault
doth
make
the
fault
the
worse
by
th
excuse
as

upon

discredit
more

to

effect
before
you
were

it
and
we
are
all
well
pleasd
since
all
and
every
part
of
what
we

doth

at

your

some
reasons
of
this
double
coronation
i
have
possessd
you
with

think
them
strong
and
more
more
strong
when
lesser
is
my
fear
i
shall
indue
you
with

but
ask
what
you
would
have
reformd
that
is
not
well
and
well
shall
you
perceive
how
willingly
i
will
both
hear
and
grant
you
your

pembroke
then
i
as
one
that
am
the
tongue
of
these
to
sound
the
purposes
of
all
their
hearts
both
for
myself
and
them
but
chief
of
all
your
safety
for
the
which
myself
and
them
bend
their
best
studies
heartily
request
th
enfranchisement
of
arthur
whose
restraint
doth
move
the
murmuring
lips
of
discontent
to
break
into
this
dangerous
argument
if
what
in

you
have
in

you
hold
why
then
your

as
they
say

move
you
to
mew
up
your
tender
kinsman
and
to
choke
his
days
with
barbarous
ignorance
and
deny
his

the
rich
advantage
of
good
exercise
that
the
times
enemies
may
not
have
this
to

let
it
be

you

for

we
do
no
further
ask

hubert
what
news
with
you
pembroke
this
is
the
man
should
do
the
bloody
deed
he
showd
his
warrant
to
a
friend
of
mine
the
image
of
a
wicked
heinous
fault
lives
in
his
eye
that
close
aspect
of
his
doth
show
the
mood
of
a
much
troubled
breast
and
i
do
fearfully
believe
tis
done
what
we
so
feard
he
had
a
charge
to
do
salisbury
the
colour
of
the
king
doth
come
and
go
between
his
purpose
and
his
conscience
like
heralds
twixt
two
dreadful
battles
set
his
passion
is
so
ripe
it
needs
must
break
pembroke
and
when
it
breaks
i
fear
will
issue
thence
the
foul
corruption
of
a
sweet
childs
death
king
john
we
cannot
hold
mortalitys
strong
hand
good
lords
although
my
will
to
give
is
living
the
suit
which
you
demand
is
gone
and
dead
he
tells
us
arthur
is
deceasd
tonight
salisbury
indeed
we
feard
his
sickness
was
past
cure
pembroke
indeed
we
heard
how
near
his
death
he
was
before
the
child
himself
felt
he
was
sick
this
must
be
answerd
either
here
or
hence
king
john
why
do
you
bend
such
solemn
brows
on
me
think
you
i
bear
the
shears
of
destiny
have
i
commandment
on
the
pulse
of
life
salisbury
it
is
apparent
foulplay
and
tis
shame
that
greatness
should
so
grossly
offer
it
so
thrive
it
in
your
game
and
so
farewell
pembroke
stay

by

a

this
murder
had
not
come

but
taking
note
of
thy
abhorrd
aspect
finding
thee
fit
for
bloody
villainy
apt
liable
to
be
employd
in
danger
i
faintly
broke
with
thee
of
arthurs
death
and
thou
to

endeared
to
a

made
it
no
conscience
to
destroy
a
prince
hubert
my

hadst
thou

turnd
an

of
doubt
upon

as

me

deep
shame
had
struck
me
dumb
made
me
break
off
and
those
thy

might
have
wrought
fears

thou
didst
understand
me
by
my
signs
and
didst
in
signs
again
parley
with
sin
yea
without
stop
didst
let
thy
heart
consent
and
consequently
thy
rude
hand
to
act
the
deed
which
both
our
tongues
held
vile
to
name
out
of
my
sight
and
never
see
me
more
my

leave
me

my

is
braved

the

that
ever
spider
twisted
from

will
serve
to
strangle
thee
a

thorns

how
easy
dost
thou
take
all
england
up
from
forth
this
morsel
of
dead
royalty
the
life
the
right
and
truth
of
all
this
realm
is
fled
to
heaven
and
england
now
is
left
to
tug
and
scamble
and
to
part
by
th
teeth
the
unowed
interest
of

now
for
the
barepickd
bone
of

doth
dogged
war
bristle
his
angry
crest
and
snarleth
in
the
gentle
eyes
of

now
powers
from

and
discontents
at
home
meet
in
one

and
vast
confusion
waits
as
doth
a

now
happy

let

keep

safe
for

return
the

to
these

again
that
having
our
fair

written
down
both
they

we
perusing

noble
dauphin
albeit
we
swear
a

an
unurgd
faith
to

yet
believe
me
prince
i
am
not
glad
that
such
a
sore
of
time
should
seek
a
plaster
by
contemnd
revolt
and
heal
the
inveterate
canker
of
one
wound
by
making
many
o
it
grieves
my
soul
that
i
must
draw
this

to
be
a
widowmaker
o
and
there
where
honourable
rescue
and
defence
cries
out
upon
the
name
of
salisbury
but
such
is
the
infection
of
the
time
that
for
the
health
and
physic
of
our
right
we
cannot
deal
but
with
the
very
hand
of
stern
injustice
and
confused
wrong
and
ist
not
pity
o
my
grieved
friends
that
we
the
sons
and
children
of
this
isle
were
born
to
see
so
sad
an
hour
as
this
wherein
we
step
after
a
strangermarch
upon
her
gentle
bosom
and
fill
up
her
enemies
ranksi
must
withdraw
and
weep
upon
the
spot
of
this
enforced
cause
to
grace
the
gentry
of
a
land
remote
and
follow
unacquainted
colours
here
what
here
o
nation
that
thou
couldst
remove
that
neptunes
arms
who
clippeth
thee
about
would
bear
thee
from
the
knowledge
of

and
grapple
thee
unto
a
pagan
shore
where
these
two
christian
armies
might
combine
the
blood
of
malice
in
a
vein
of
league
and
not
to
spend
it
so
unneighbourly
lewis
a
noble
temper
dost
thou
show
in
this
and
great
affections
wrestling
in
thy
bosom
doth
make
an
earthquake
of
nobility
o
what
a
noble
combat
hast
thou
fought
between
compulsion
and
a
brave
respect
let
me
wipe
off
this
honourable
dew
that
silverly
doth
progress
on
thy
cheeks
my
heart
hath
melted
at
a
ladys
tears
being
an
ordinary
inundation
but
this
effusion
of
such
manly
drops
this
showr
blown
up
by
tempest
of
the
soul
startles
mine
eyes
and
makes
me
more
amazd
than
had
i
seen
the
vaulty
top
of

figurd
quite
oer
with
burning
meteors
lift
up
thy
brow
renowned
salisbury
and
with
a
great

heave
away
this

commend
these

to
those
baby
eyes
that
never
saw
the
giant
world
enragd
nor
met
with
fortune
other
than
at
feasts
full
of
warm
blood
of
mirth
of
gossiping
come
come
for
thou
shalt
thrust
thy
hand
as
deep
into
the
purse
of

prosperity
as

all
that
knit
your
sinews
to

and
even
there
methinks
an

look
where
the
holy
legate
comes
apace
to
give

warrant
from
the
hand
of

and
on

set
the
name

therefore
thy
threatning
colours
now
wind
up

the
savage
spirit
of
wild
war
that
like
a
lion
fostered
up
at

it
may
lie
gently
at

cassius
i
pray
you
do
brutus
i
am
not
gamesome
i
do
lack
some
part
of
that
quick
spirit
that
is
in
antony
let
me
not
hinder
cassius
your
desires
ill
leave
you
cassius
brutus
i
do
observe
you
now
of
late
i
have
not
from
your
eyes
that
gentleness
and
show
of
love
as
i
was
wont
to
have
you
bear
too
stubborn
and
too
strange
a
hand
over
your
friend
that
loves
you
brutus
cassius
be
not
deceived
if
i
have
veild
my
look
i
turn
the
trouble
of
my
countenance
merely
upon
myself
vexed
i
am
of
late
with
passions
of
some
difference
conceptions
only
proper
to
myself
which
give
some
soil
perhaps
to
my
behaviors
but
let
not
therefore
my
good
friends
be
grieved
among
which
number
cassius
be
you
one
nor
construe
any
further
my
neglect
than
that
poor
brutus
with
himself
at
war
forgets
the
shows
of
love
to
other
men
cassius
then
brutus
i
have
much
mistook
your
passion
by
means
whereof
this
breast
of
mine
hath
buried
thoughts
of
great
value
worthy
cogitations
tell
me
good
brutus
can
you
see
your
face
brutus
no
cassius
for
the
eye
sees
not
itself
but
by
reflection
by
some
other
things
cassius
tis
just
and
it
is
very
much
lamented
brutus
that
you
have
no
such
mirrors
as
will
turn
your
hidden
worthiness
into
your
eye
that
you
might
see
your
shadow
i
have
heard
where
many
of
the
best
respect
in
rome
except
immortal
caesar
speaking
of
brutus
and
groaning
underneath
this
ages
yoke
have
wishd
that
noble
brutus
had
his
eyes
brutus
into
what
dangers
would
you
lead
me
cassius
that
you
would
have
me
seek
into
myself
for
that
which
is
not
in
me
cassius
therefore
good
brutus
be
prepared
to
hear
and
since
you
know
you
cannot
see
yourself
so
well
as
by
reflection
i
your
glass
will
modestly
discover
to
yourself
that
of
yourself
which
you
yet
know
not
of
and
be
not
jealous
on
me
gentle
brutus
were
i
a
common
laugher
or
did
use
to
stale
with
ordinary
oaths
my
love
to
every
new
protester
if
you
know
that
i
do
fawn
on
men
and
hug
them
hard
and
after
scandal
them
or
if
you
know
that
i
profess
myself
in
banqueting
to
all
the
rout
then
hold
me
dangerous
flourish
and
shout
brutus
what
means
this
shouting
i
do
fear
the
people
choose
caesar
for
their
king
cassius
ay
do
you
fear
it
then
must
i
think
you
would
not
have
it
so
brutus
i
would
not
cassius
yet
i
love
him
well
but
wherefore
do
you
hold
me
here
so
long
what
is
it
that
you
would
impart
to
me
if
it
be
aught
toward
the
general
good
set
honor
in
one
eye
and
death
i
the
other
and
i
will
look
on
both
indifferently
for
let
the
gods
so
speed
me
as
i
love
the
name
of
honor
more
than
i
fear
death
cassius
i
know
that
virtue
to
be
in
you
brutus
as
well
as
i
do
know
your
outward
favor
well
honor
is
the
subject
of
my
story
i
cannot
tell
what
you
and
other
men
think
of
this
life
but
for
my
single
self
i
had
as
lief
not
be
as
live
to
be
in
awe
of
such
a
thing
as
i
myself
i
was
born
free
as
caesar
so
were
you
we
both
have
fed
as
well
and
we
can
both
endure
the
winters
cold
as
well
as
he
for
once
upon
a
raw
and
gusty
day
the
troubled
tiber
chafing
with
her
shores
caesar
said
to
me
darest
thou
cassius
now
leap
in
with
me
into
this
angry
flood
and
swim
to
yonder
point
upon
the
word
accoutred
as
i
was
i
plunged
in
and
bade
him
follow
so
indeed
he
did
the
torrent
roard
and
we
did
buffet
it
with
lusty
sinews
throwing
it
aside
and
stemming
it
with
hearts
of
controversy
but
ere
we
could
arrive
the
point
proposed
caesar
cried
help
me
cassius
or
i
sink
i
as
aeneas
our
great
ancestor
did
from
the
flames
of
troy
upon
his
shoulder
the
old
anchises
bear
so
from
the
waves
of
tiber
did
i
the
tired
caesar
and
this
man
is
now
become
a
god
and
cassius
is
a
wretched
creature
and
must
bend
his
body
if
caesar
carelessly
but
nod
on
him
he
had
a
fever
when
he
was
in
spain
and
when
the
fit
was
on
him
i
did
mark
how
he
did
shake
tis
true
this
god
did
shake
his
coward
lips
did
from
their
color
fly
and
that
same
eye
whose
bend
doth
awe
the
world
did
lose
his
luster
i
did
hear
him
groan
ay
and
that
tongue
of
his
that
bade
the
romans
mark
him
and
write
his
speeches
in
their
books
alas
it
cried
give
me
some
drink
titinius
as
a
sick
girl
ye
gods
it
doth
amaze
me
a
man
of
such
a
feeble
temper
should
so
get
the
start
of
the
majestic
world
and
bear
the
palm
alone
shout



















flourish
brutus
another
general
shout
i
do
believe
that
these
applauses
are
for
some
new
honors
that
are
heapd
on
caesar
cassius
why
man
he
doth
bestride
the
narrow
world
like
a
colossus
and
we
petty
men
walk
under
his
huge
legs
and
peep
about
to
find
ourselves
dishonorable
graves
men
at
some
time
are
masters
of
their
fates
the
fault
dear
brutus
is
not
in
our
stars
but
in
ourselves
that
we
are
underlings
brutus
and
caesar
what
should
be
in
that
caesar
why
should
that
name
be
sounded
more
than
yours
write
them
together
yours
is
as
fair
a
name
sound
them
it
doth
become
the
mouth
as
well
weigh
them
it
is
as
heavy
conjure
with
em
brutus
will
start
a
spirit
as
soon
as
caesar
now
in
the
names
of
all
the
gods
at
once
upon
what
meat
doth
this
our
caesar
feed
that
he
is
grown
so
great
age
thou
art
shamed
rome
thou
hast
lost
the
breed
of
noble
bloods
when
went
there
by
an
age
since
the
great
flood
but
it
was
famed
with
more
than
with
one
man
when
could
they
say
till
now
that
talkd
of
rome
that
her
wide
walls
encompassd
but
one
man
now
is
it
rome
indeed
and
room
enough
when
there
is
in
it
but
one
only
man
o
you
and
i
have
heard
our
fathers
say
there
was
a
brutus
once
that
would
have
brookd
the
eternal
devil
to
keep
his
state
in
rome
as
easily
as
a
king
brutus
that
you
do
love
me
i
am
nothing
jealous
what
you
would
work
me
to
i
have
some
aim
how
i
have
thought
of
this
and
of
these
times
i
shall
recount
hereafter
for
this
present
i
would
not
so
with
love
i
might
entreat
you
be
any
further
moved
what
you
have
said
i
will
consider
what
you
have
to
say
i
will
with
patience
hear
and
find
a
time
both
meet
to
hear
and
answer
such
high
things
till
then
my
noble
friend
chew
upon
this
brutus
had
rather
be
a
villager
than
to
repute
himself
a
son
of
rome
under
these
hard
conditions
as
this
time
is
like
to
lay
upon
us
cassius
i
am
glad
that
my
weak
words
have
struck
but
thus
much
show
of
fire
from
brutus

reenter
caesar
and
his
train

brutus
the
games
are
done
and
caesar
is
returning
cassius
as
they
pass
by
pluck
casca
by
the
sleeve
and
he
will
after
his
sour
fashion
tell
you
what
hath
proceeded
worthy
note
today
brutus
i
will
do
so
but
look
you
cassius
the
angry
spot
doth
glow
on
caesars
brow
and
all
the
rest
look
like
a
chidden
train
calpurnias
cheek
is
pale
and
cicero
looks
with
such
ferret
and
such
fiery
eyes
as
we
have
seen
him
in
the
capitol
being
crossd
in
conference
by
some
senators
cassius
casca
will
tell
us
what
the
matter
is
caesar
antonio
antony
caesar
caesar
let
me
have
men
about
me
that
are
fat
sleekheaded
men
and
such
as
sleep
o
nights
yond
cassius
has
a
lean
and
hungry
look
he
thinks
too
much
such
men
are
dangerous
antony
fear
him
not
caesar
hes
not
dangerous
he
is
a
noble
roman
and
well
given
caesar
would
he
were
fatter
but
i
fear
him
not
yet
if
my
name
were
liable
to
fear
i
do
not
know
the
man
i
should
avoid
so
soon
as
that
spare
cassius
he
reads
much
he
is
a
great
observer
and
he
looks
quite
through
the
deeds
of
men
he
loves
no
plays
as
thou
dost
antony
he
hears
no
music
seldom
he
smiles
and
smiles
in
such
a
sort
as
if
he
mockd
himself
and
scornd
his
spirit
that
could
be
moved
to
smile
at
anything
such
men
as
he
be
never
at
hearts
ease
whiles
they
behold
a
greater
than
themselves
and
therefore
are
they
very
dangerous
i
rather
tell
thee
what
is
to
be
feard
than
what
i
fear
for
always
i
am
caesar
come
on
my
right
hand
for
this
ear
is
deaf
and
tell
me
truly
what
thou
thinkst
of
him
sennet
exeunt
caesar
and
all
his
train
but
casca
casca
you
pulld
me
by
the
cloak
would
you
speak
with
me
brutus
ay
casca
tell
us
what
hath
chanced
today
that
caesar
looks
so
sad
casca
why
you
were
with
him
were
you
not
brutus
i
should
not
then
ask
casca
what
had
chanced
casca
why
there
was
a
crown
offered
him
and
being
offered
him
he
put
it
by
with
the
back
of
his
hand
thus
and
then
the
people
fell
ashouting
brutus
what
was
the
second
noise
for
casca
why
for
that
too
cassius
they
shouted
thrice
what
was
the
last
cry
for
casca
why
for
that
too
brutus
was
the
crown
offered
him
thrice
casca
ay
marry
wast
and
he
put
it
by
thrice
every
time
gentler
than
other
and
at
every
putting
by
mine
honest
neighbors
shouted
cassius
who
offered
him
the
crown
casca
why
antony
brutus
tell
us
the
manner
of
it
gentle
casca
casca
i
can
as
well
be
hangd
as
tell
the
manner
of
it
it
was
mere
foolery
i
did
not
mark
it
i
saw
mark
antony
offer
him
a
crown
yet
twas
not
a
crown
neither
twas
one
of
these
coronets
and
as
i
told
you
he
put
it
by
once
but
for
all
that
to
my
thinking
he
would
fain
have
had
it
then
he
offered
it
to
him
again
then
he
put
it
by
again
but
to
my
thinking
he
was
very
loath
to
lay
his
fingers
off
it
and
then
he
offered
it
the
third
time
he
put
it
the
third
time
by
and
still
as
he
refused
it
the
rabblement
hooted
and
clapped
their
chopped
hands
and
threw
up
their
sweaty
nightcaps
and
uttered
such
a
deal
of
stinking
breath
because
caesar
refused
the
crown
that
it
had
almost
choked
caesar
for
he
swounded
and
fell
down
at
it
and
for
mine
own
part
i
durst
not
laugh
for
fear
of
opening
my
lips
and
receiving
the
bad
air
cassius
but
soft
i
pray
you
what
did
caesars
wound
casca
he
fell
down
in
the
marketplace
and
foamed
at
mouth
and
was
speechless
brutus
tis
very
like
he
hath
the
falling
sickness
cassius
no
caesar
hath
it
not
but
you
and
i
and
honest
casca
we
have
the
falling
sickness
casca
i
know
not
what
you
mean
by
that
but
i
am
sure
caesar
fell
down
if
the
tagrag
people
did
not
clap
him
and
hiss
him
according
as
he
pleased
and
displeased
them
as
they
use
to
do
the
players
in
the
theatre
i
am
no
true
man
brutus
what
said
he
when
he
came
unto
himself
casca
marry
before
he
fell
down
when
he
perceived
the
common
herd
was
glad
he
refused
the
crown
he
plucked
me
ope
his
doublet
and
offered
them
his
throat
to
cut
an
had
been
a
man
of
any
occupation
if
i
would
not
have
taken
him
at
a
word
i
would
i
might
go
to
hell
among
the
rogues
and
so
he
fell
when
he
came
to
himself
again
he
said
if
he
had
done
or
said
anything
amiss
he
desired
their
worships
to
think
it
was
his
infirmity
three
or
four
wenches
where
i
stood
cried
alas
good
soul
and
forgave
him
with
all
their
hearts
but
theres
no
heed
to
be
taken
of
them
if
caesar
had
stabbed
their
mothers
they
would
have
done
no
less
brutus
and
after
that
he
came
thus
sad
away
casca
ay
cassius
did
cicero
say
anything
casca
ay
he
spoke
greek
cassius
to
what
effect
casca
nay
an
i
tell
you
that
ill
neer
look
you
i
the
face
again
but
those
that
understood
him
smiled
at
one
another
and
shook
their
heads
but
for
mine
own
part
it
was
greek
to
me
i
could
tell
you
more
news
too
marullus
and
flavius
for
pulling
scarfs
off
caesars
images
are
put
to
silence
fare
you
well
there
was
more
foolery
yet
if
could
remember
it
cassius
will
you
sup
with
me
tonight
casca
casca
no
i
am
promised
forth
cassius
will
you
dine
with
me
tomorrow
casca
ay
if
i
be
alive
and
your
mind
hold
and
your
dinner
worth
the
eating
cassius
good
i
will
expect
you
casca
do
so
farewell
both



























exit
brutus
what
a
blunt
fellow
is
this
grown
to
be
he
was
quick
mettle
when
he
went
to
school
cassius
so
is
he
now
in
execution
of
any
bold
or
noble
enterprise
however
he
puts
on
this
tardy
form
this
rudeness
is
a
sauce
to
his
good
wit
which
gives
men
stomach
to
digest
his
words
with
better
appetite
brutus
and
so
it
is
for
this
time
i
will
leave
you
tomorrow
if
you
please
to
speak
with
me
i
will
come
home
to
you
or
if
you
will
come
home
to
me
and
i
will
wait
for
you
cassius
i
will
do
so
till
then
think
of
the
world
exit
brutus
well
brutus
thou
art
noble
yet
i
see
thy
honorable
mettle
may
be
wrought
from
that
it
is
disposed
therefore
it
is
meet
that
noble
minds
keep
ever
with
their
likes
for
who
so
firm
that
cannot
be
seduced
caesar
doth
bear
me
hard
but
he
loves
brutus
if
i
were
brutus
now
and
he
were
cassius
he
should
not
humor
me
i
will
this
night
in
several
hands
in
at
his
windows
throw
as
if
they
came
from
several
citizens
writings
all
tending
to
the
great
opinion
that
rome
holds
of
his
name
wherein
obscurely
caesars
ambition
shall
be
glanced
at
and
after
this
let
caesar
seat
him
sure
for
we
will
shake
him
or
worse
days
endure

scene
iii
a
street
thunder
and
lightning

enter
from
opposite
sides
casca
with
his
sword
drawn
and
cicero

cicero
good
even
casca
brought
you
caesar
home
why
are
you
breathless
and
why
stare
you
so
casca
are
not
you
moved
when
all
the
sway
of
earth
shakes
like
a
thing
unfirm
o
cicero
i
have
seen
tempests
when
the
scolding
winds
have
rived
the
knotty
oaks
and
i
have
seen
the
ambitious
ocean
swell
and
rage
and
foam
to
be
exalted
with
the
threatening
clouds
but
never
till
tonight
never
till
now
did
i
go
through
a
tempest
dropping
fire
either
there
is
a
civil
strife
in
heaven
or
else
the
world
too
saucy
with
the
gods
incenses
them
to
send
destruction
cicero
why
saw
you
anything
more
wonderful
casca
a
common
slave
you
know
him
well
by
sight
held
up
his
left
hand
which
did
flame
and
burn
like
twenty
torches
joind
and
yet
his
hand
not
sensible
of
fire
remaind
unscorchd
besides
i
ha
not
since
put
up
my
sword
against
the
capitol
i
met
a
lion
who
glazd
upon
me
and
went
surly
by
without
annoying
me
and
there
were
drawn
upon
a
heap
a
hundred
ghastly
women
transformed
with
their
fear
who
swore
they
saw
men
all
in
fire
walk
up
and
down
the
streets
and
yesterday
the
bird
of
night
did
sit
even
at
noonday
upon
the
marketplace
howling
and
shrieking
when
these
prodigies
do
so
conjointly
meet
let
not
men
say
these
are
their
reasons
they
are
natural
for
i
believe
they
are
portentous
things
unto
the
climate
that
they
point
upon
cicero
indeed
it
is
a
strangedisposed
time
but
men
may
construe
things
after
their
fashion
clean
from
the
purpose
of
the
things
themselves
comes
caesar
to
the
capitol
tomorrow
casca
he
doth
for
he
did
bid
antonio
send
word
to
you
he
would
be
there
tomorrow
cicero
good
then
casca
this
disturbed
sky
is
not
to
walk
in
casca
farewell
cicero

























exit
cicero

enter
cassius

cassius
whos
there
casca
a
roman
cassius
casca
by
your
voice
casca
your
ear
is
good
cassius
what
night
is
this
cassius
a
very
pleasing
night
to
honest
men
casca
who
ever
knew
the
heavens
menace
so
cassius
those
that
have
known
the
earth
so
full
of
faults
for
my
part
i
have
walkd
about
the
streets
submitting
me
unto
the
perilous
night
and
thus
unbraced
casca
as
you
see
have
bared
my
bosom
to
the
thunderstone
and
when
the
cross
blue
lightning
seemd
to
open
the
breast
of
heaven
i
did
present
myself
even
in
the
aim
and
very
flash
of
it
casca
but
wherefore
did
you
so
much
tempt
the
heavens
it
is
the
part
of
men
to
fear
and
tremble
when
the
most
mighty
gods
by
tokens
send
such
dreadful
heralds
to
astonish
us
cassius
you
are
dull
casca
and
those
sparks
of
life
that
should
be
in
a
roman
you
do
want
or
else
you
use
not
you
look
pale
and
gaze
and
put
on
fear
and
cast
yourself
in
wonder
to
see
the
strange
impatience
of
the
heavens
but
if
you
would
consider
the
true
cause
why
all
these
fires
why
all
these
gliding
ghosts
why
birds
and
beasts
from
quality
and
kind
why
old
men
fools
and
children
calculate
why
all
these
things
change
from
their
ordinance
their
natures
and
preformed
faculties
to
monstrous
quality
why
you
shall
find
that
heaven
hath
infused
them
with
these
spirits
to
make
them
instruments
of
fear
and
warning
unto
some
monstrous
state
now
could
i
casca
name
to
thee
a
man
most
like
this
dreadful
night
that
thunders
lightens
opens
graves
and
roars
as
doth
the
lion
in
the
capitol
a
man
no
mightier
than
thyself
or
me
in
personal
action
yet
prodigious
grown
and
fearful
as
these
strange
eruptions
are
casca
tis
caesar
that
you
mean
is
it
not
cassius
cassius
let
it
be
who
it
is
for
romans
now
have
thews
and
limbs
like
to
their
ancestors
but
woe
the
while
our
fathers
minds
are
dead
and
we
are
governd
with
our
mothers
spirits
our
yoke
and
sufferance
show
us
womanish
casca
indeed
they
say
the
senators
tomorrow
mean
to
establish
caesar
as
a
king
and
he
shall
wear
his
crown
by
sea
and
land
in
every
place
save
here
in
italy
cassius
i
know
where
i
will
wear
this
dagger
then
cassius
from
bondage
will
deliver
cassius
therein
ye
gods
you
make
the
weak
most
strong
therein
ye
gods
you
tyrants
do
defeat
nor
stony
tower
nor
walls
of
beaten
brass
nor
airless
dungeon
nor
strong
links
of
iron
can
be
retentive
to
the
strength
of
spirit
but
life
being
weary
of
these
worldly
bars
never
lacks
power
to
dismiss
itself
if
i
know
this
know
all
the
world
besides
that
part
of
tyranny
that
i
do
bear
i
can
shake
off
at
pleasure

















thunder
still
casca
so
can
i
so
every
bondman
in
his
own
hand
bears
the
power
to
cancel
his
captivity
cassius
and
why
should
caesar
be
a
tyrant
then
poor
man
i
know
he
would
not
be
a
wolf
but
that
he
sees
the
romans
are
but
sheep
he
were
no
lion
were
not
romans
hinds
those
that
with
haste
will
make
a
mighty
fire
begin
it
with
weak
straws
what
trash
is
rome
what
rubbish
and
what
offal
when
it
serves
for
the
base
matter
to
illuminate
so
vile
a
thing
as
caesar
but
o
grief
where
hast
thou
led
me
i
perhaps
speak
this
before
a
willing
bondman
then
i
know
my
answer
must
be
made
but
i
am
armd
and
dangers
are
to
me
indifferent
casca
you
speak
to
casca
and
to
such
a
man
that
is
no
fleering
telltale
hold
my
hand
be
factious
for
redress
of
all
these
griefs
and
i
will
set
this
foot
of
mine
as
far
as
who
goes
farthest
cassius
theres
a
bargain
made
now

i
have
moved
already
some
certain
of
the
noblestminded
romans
to
undergo
with
me
an
enterprise
of
honorabledangerous
consequence
and
i
do
know
by
this
they
stay
for
me
in
pompeys
porch
for
now
this
fearful
night
there
is
no
stir
or
walking
in
the
streets
and
the
complexion

the
element
in
favors

work

terrible

scene
i

enter
brutus
in
his
orchard

brutus
what
lucius
ho
i
cannot
by
the
progress
of
the
stars
give
guess
how
near
to
day
lucius
i
say
i
would
it
were
my
fault
to
sleep
so
soundly
when
lucius
when
awake
i
say
what
lucius

enter
lucius

lucius
calld
you
my
lord
brutus
get
me
a
taper
in
my
study
lucius
when
it
is
lighted
come
and
call
me
here
lucius
i
will
my
lord
































exit
brutus
it
must
be
by
his
death
and
for
my
part
i
know
no
personal
cause
to
spurn
at
him
but
for
the
general
he
would
be
crownd
how
that
might
change
his
nature
theres
the
question
it
is
the
bright
day
that
brings
forth
the
adder
and
that
craves
wary
walking
crown
him
that
and
then
i
grant
we
put
a
sting
in
him
that
at
his
will
he
may
do
danger
with
the
abuse
of
greatness
is
when
it
disjoins
remorse
from
power
and
to
speak
truth
of
caesar
i
have
not
known
when
his
affections
swayd
more
than
his
reason
but
tis
a
common
proof
that
lowliness
is
young
ambitions
ladder
whereto
the
climberupward
turns
his
face
but
when
he
once
attains
the
upmost
round
he
then
unto
the
ladder
turns
his
back
looks
in
the
clouds
scorning
the
base
degrees
by
which
he
did
ascend
so
caesar
may
then
lest
he
may
prevent
and
since
the
quarrel
will
bear
no
color
for
the
thing
he
is
fashion
it
thus
that
what
he
is
augmented
would
run
to
these
and
these
extremities
and
therefore
think
him
as
a
serpents
egg
which
hatchd
would
as
his
kind
grow
mischievous
and
kill
him
in
the
shell

since

against
caesar
i
have
not
slept
between
the
acting
of
a
dreadful
thing
and
the
first
motion
all
the
interim
is
like
a
phantasma
or
a
hideous
dream
the
genius
and
the
mortal
instruments
are
then
in
council
and
the
state
of
man
like
to
a
little
kingdom
suffers
then
the
nature
of
an
insurrection

i

we
are
too
bold
upon
your
rest
good
morrow
brutus
do
we
trouble
you
brutus
i
have
been
up
this
hour
awake
all
night
know
i
these
men
that
come
along
with
you
cassius
yes
every
man
of
them
and
no
man
here
but
honors
you
and
every
one
doth
wish
you
had
but
that
opinion
of
yourself
which
every
noble
roman
bears
of
you
this
is
trebonius
brutus
he
is
welcome
hither
cassius
this
decius
brutus
brutus
he
is
welcome
too
cassius
this
casca
this
cinna
and
this
metellus
cimber
brutus
they
are
all
welcome
what
watchful
cares
do
interpose
themselves
betwixt
your
eyes
and
night
cassius
shall
i
entreat
a
word
















they
whisper
decius
here
lies
the
east
doth
not
the
day
break
here
casca
no
cinna
o
pardon
sir
it
doth
and
yongrey
lines
that
fret
the
clouds
are
messengers
of
day
casca
you
shall
confess
that
you
are
both
deceived
here
as
i
point
my
sword
the
sun
arises
which
is
a
great
way
growing
on
the
south
weighing
the
youthful
season
of
the
year
some
two
months
hence
up
higher
toward
the
north
he
first
presents
his
fire
and
the
high
east
stands
as
the
capitol
directly
here
brutus
give
me
your
hands
all
over
one
by
one
cassius
and
let
us
swear
our
resolution
brutus
no
not
an
oath
if
not
the
face
of
men
the
sufferance
of
our
souls
the
times
abuse
if
these
be
motives
weak
break
off
betimes
and
every
man
hence
to
his
idle
bed
so
let
highsighted
tyranny
range
on
till
each
man
drop
by
lottery
but
if
these
as
i
am
sure
they
do
bear
fire
enough
to
kindle
cowards
and
to
steel
with
valor
the
melting
spirits
of
women
then
countrymen
what
need
we
any
spur
but
our
own
cause
to
prick
us
to
redress
what
other
bond
than
secret
romans
that
have
spoke
the
word
and
will
not
palter
and
what
other
oath
than
honesty
to
honesty
engaged
that
this
shall
be
or
we
will
fall
for
it
swear
priests
and
cowards
and
men
cautelous
old
feeble
carrions
and
such
suffering
souls
that
welcome
wrongs
unto
bad
causes
swear
such
creatures
as
men
doubt
but
do
not
stain
the
even
virtue
of
our
enterprise
nor
the
insuppressive
mettle
of
our
spirits
to
think
that
or
our
cause
or
our
performance
did
need
an
oath
when
every
drop
of
blood
that
every
roman
bears
and
nobly
bears
is
guilty
of
a
several
bastardy
if
he
do
break
the
smallest
particle
of
any
promise
that
hath
passd
from
him
cassius
but
what
of
cicero
shall
we
sound
him
i
think
he
will
stand
very
strong
with
us
casca
let
us
not
leave
him
out
cinna
no
by
no
means
metellus
o
let
us
have
him
for
his
silver
hairs
will
purchase
us
a
good
opinion
and
buy
mens
voices
to
commend
our
deeds
it
shall
be
said
his
judgement
ruled
our
hands
our
youths
and
wildness
shall
no
whit
appear
but
all
be
buried
in
his
gravity
brutus
o
name
him
not
let
us
not
break
with
him
for
he
will
never
follow
anything
that
other
men
begin
cassius
then
leave
him
out
casca
indeed
he
is
not
fit
decius
shall
no
man
else
be
touchd
but
only
caesar
cassius
decius
well
urged
i
think
it
is
not
meet
mark
antony
so
well
beloved
of
caesar
should
outlive
caesar
we
shall
find
of
him
a
shrewd
contriver
and
you
know
his
means
if
he
improve
them
may
well
stretch
so
far
as
to
annoy
us
all
which
to
prevent
let
antony
and
caesar
fall
together
brutus
our
course
will
seem
too
bloody
caius
cassius
to
cut
the
head
off
and
then
hack
the
limbs
like
wrath
in
death
and
envy
afterwards
for
antony
is
but
a
limb
of
caesar
let
us
be
sacrificers
but
not
butchers
caius
we
all
stand
up
against
the
spirit
of
caesar
and
in
the
spirit
of
men
there
is
no
blood
o
that
we
then
could
come
by
caesars
spirit
and
not
dismember
caesar
but
alas
caesar
must
bleed
for
it
and
gentle
friends
lets
kill
him
boldly
but
not
wrathfully
lets
carve
him
as
a
dish
fit
for
the
gods
not
hew
him
as
a
carcass
fit
for
hounds
and
let
our
hearts
as
subtle
masters
do
stir
up
their
servants
to
an
act
of
rage
and
after
seem
to
chide
em
this
shall
make
our
purpose
necessary
and
not
envious
which
so
appearing
to
the
common
eyes
we
shall
be
calld
purgers
not
murderers
and
for
mark
antony
think
not
of
him
for
he
can
do
no
more
than
caesars
arm
when
caesars
head
is
off
cassius
yet
i
fear
him
for
in
the
ingrated
love
he
bears
to
caesar
brutus
alas
good
cassius
do
not
think
of
him
if
he
love
caesar
all
that
he
can
do
is
to
himself
take
thought
and
die
for
caesar
and
that
were
much
he
should
for
he
is
given
to
sports
to
wildness
and
much
company
trebonius
there
is
no
fear
in
himlet
him
not
die
for
he
will
live
and
laugh
at
this
hereafter
clock
strikes
brutus
peace
count
the
clock
cassius
the
clock
hath
stricken
three
trebonius
tis
time
to
part
cassius
but
it
is
doubtful
yet
whether
caesar
will
come
forth
today
or
no
for
he
is
superstitious
grown
of
late
quite
from
the
main
opinion
he
held
once
of
fantasy
of
dreams
and
ceremonies
it
may
be
these
apparent
prodigies
the
unaccustomd
terror
of
this
night
and
the
persuasion
of
his
augurers
may
hold
him
from
the
capitol
today
decius
never
fear
that
if
he
be
so
resolved
i
can
oersway
him
for
he
loves
to
hear
that
unicorns
may
be
betrayd
with
trees
and
bears
with
glasses
elephants
with
holes
lions
with
toils
and
men
with
flatterers
but
when
i
tell
him
he
hates
flatterers
he
says
he
does
being
then
most
flattered
let
me
work
for
i
can
give
his
humor
the
true
bent
and
i
will
bring
him
to
the
capitol
cassius
nay
we
will
all
of
us
be
there
to
fetch
him
brutus
by
the
eighth
hour
is
that
the
utter
most
cinna
be
that
the
uttermost
and
fail
not
then
metellus
caius
ligarius
doth
bear
caesar
hard
who
rated
him
for
speaking
well
of
pompey
i
wonder
none
of
you
have
thought
of
him
brutus
now
good
metellus
go
along
by
him
he
loves
me
well
and
i
have
given
him
reasons
send
him
but
hither
and
ill
fashion
him
cassius
the
morning
comes
upon
s
well
leave
you
brutus
and
friends
disperse
yourselves
but
all
remember
what
you
have
said
and
show
yourselves
true
romans
brutus
good
gentlemen
look
fresh
and
merrily
let
not
our
looks
put
on
our
purposes
but
bear
it
as
our
roman
actors
do
with
untired
spirits
and
formal
constancy
and
so
good
morrow
to
you
every
one
exeunt
all
but
brutus
boy
lucius
fast
asleep
it
is
no
matter
enjoy
the
honeyheavy
dew
of
slumber
thou
hast
no
figures
nor
no
fantasies
which
busy
care
draws
in
the
brains
of
men
therefore
thou
sleepst
so
sound

enter
portia

portia
brutus
my
lord
brutus
portia
what
mean
you
wherefore
rise
you
now
it
is
not
for
your
health
thus
to
commit
your
weak
condition
to
the
raw
cold
morning
portia
nor
for
yours
neither
have
ungently
brutus
stole
from
my
bed
and
yesternight
at
supper
you
suddenly
arose
and
walkd
about
musing
and
sighing
with
your
arms
across
and
when
i
askd
you
what
the
matter
was
you
stared
upon
me
with
ungentle
looks
i
urged
you
further
then
you
scratchd
your
head
and
too
impatiently
stampd
with
your
foot
yet
i
insisted
yet
you
answerd
not
but
with
an
angry
waiter
of
your
hand
gave
sign
for
me
to
leave
you
so
i
did
fearing
to
strengthen
that
impatience
which
seemd
too
much
enkindled
and
withal
hoping
it
was
but
an
effect
of
humor
which
sometime
hath
his
hour
with
every
man
it
will
not
let
you
eat
nor
talk
nor
sleep
and
could
it
work
so
much
upon
your
shape
as
it
hath
much
prevaild
on
your
condition
i
should
not
know
you
brutus
dear
my
lord
make
me
acquainted
with
your
cause
of
grief
brutus
i
am
not
well
in
health
and
that
is
all
portia
brutus
is
wise
and
were
he
not
in
health
he
would
embrace
the
means
to
come
by
it
brutus
why
so
i
do
good
portia
go
to
bed
portia
is
brutus
sick
and
is
it
physical
to
walk
unbraced
and
suck
up
the
humors
of
the
dank
morning
what
is
brutus
sick
and
will
he
steal
out
of
his
wholesome
bed
to
dare
the
vile
contagion
of
the
night
and
tempt
the
rheumy
and
unpurged
air
to
add
unto
his
sickness
no
my
brutus
you
have
some
sick
offense
within
your
mind
which
by
the
right
and
virtue
of
my
place
i
ought
to
know
of
and
upon
my
knees
i
charm
you
by
my
once
commended
beauty
by
all
your
vows
of
love
and
that
great
vow
which
did
incorporate
and
make
us
one
that
you
unfold
to
me
yourself
your
half
why
you
are
heavy
and
what
men
tonight
have
had
resort
to
you
for
here
have
been
some
six
or
seven
who
did
hide
their
faces
even
from
darkness
brutus
kneel
not
gentle
portia
portia
i
should
not
need
if
you
were
gentle
brutus
within
the
bond
of
marriage
tell
me
brutus
is
it
excepted
i
should
know
no
secrets
that
appertain
to
you
am
i
yourself
but
as
it
were
in
sort
or
limitation
to
keep
with
you
at
meals
comfort
your
bed
and
talk
to
you
sometimes
dwell
i
but
in
the
suburbs
of
your
good
pleasure

calpurnia
caesar
i
i
stood
on
ceremonies
yet
now
they
fright
me
there
is
one
within
besides
the
things
that
we
have
heard
and
seen
recounts
most
horrid
sights
seen
by
the
watch
a
lioness
hath
whelped
in
the
streets
and
graves
have
yawnd
and
yielded
up
their
dead
fierce
fiery
warriors
fight
upon
the
clouds
in
ranks
and
squadrons
and
right
form
of
war
which
drizzled
blood
upon
the
capitol
the
noise
of
battle
hurtled
in
the
air
horses
did
neigh
and
dying
men
did
groan
and
ghosts
did
shriek
and
squeal
about
the
streets
o
caesar
these
things
are
beyond
all
use
and
i
do
fear
them
caesar
what
can
be
avoided
whose
end
is
purposed
by
the
mighty
gods
yet
caesar
shall
go
forth
for
these
predictions
are
to
the
world
in
general
as
to
caesar
calpurnia
when
beggars
die
there
are
no
comets
seen
the
heavens
themselves
blaze
forth
the
death
of
princes
caesar
cowards
die
many
times
before
their
deaths
the
valiant
never
taste
of
death
but
once
of
all
the
wonders
that
i
yet
have
heard
it
seems
to
me
most
strange
that
men
should
fear
seeing
that
death
a
necessary
end
will
come
when
it
will
come

not
find
a
heart
within
the
beast
caesar
the
gods
do
this
in
shame
of
cowardice
caesar

be
a

tonight

saw
my
statue
which
like
a
fountain
with
an
hundred
spouts
did
run
pure
blood
and
many
lusty
romans
came
smiling
and
did
bathe
their
hands
in
it
and
these
does
she
apply
for
warnings
and
portents
and
evils
imminent
and
on
her
knee
hath
beggd
that
i
will
stay
at
home
today
decius
this
dream
is
all
amiss
interpreted
it
was
a
vision
fair
and
fortunate
your
statue
spouting
blood
in
many
pipes
in
which
so
many
smiling
romans
bathed
signifies
that
from
you
great
rome
shall
suck
reviving
blood
and
that
great
men
shall
press
for
tinctures
stains
relics
and
cognizance
this
by
calpurnias
dream
is
signified
caesar

expounded

crown
to

caesar
if
you
shall
send

will
not
come
their
minds

a
mock
apt
to
be
renderd
for
someone
to
say
break
up
the
senate
till
another
time
when
caesars
wife
shall
meet
with
better
dreams
if
caesar
hide
himself

that
unassailable
holds
on

unshaked

he
let
me
a
little
show
it
even
in
this
that

why

cuts
off
so

brutus

that
and
then

a
benefit
so
are
we
caesars
friends
that

abridged
his

stoop
romans
stoop
and
let
us
bathe
our

in
caesars
blood
up
to

and
besmear
our

then
walk
we
forth
even
to

lets

over
in
states
unborn
and

yet
unknown
brutus
how
many

brutus
soft
who
comes
here
a
friend
of

servant
thus
brutus
did
my
master
bid
me
kneel
thus
did
mark
antony
bid
me
fall
down
and
being
prostrate
thus
he
bade
me
say
brutus
is
noble
wise
valiant
and
honest
caesar
was
mighty
bold
royal
and
loving
say
i
love
brutus
and
i
honor
him
say
i
feard
caesar
honord
him
and
loved
him
if
brutus
will
vouchsafe
that
antony
may
safely
come
to
him
and
be
resolved
how
caesar
hath
deserved
to
lie
in
death
mark
antony
shall
not
love
caesar
dead
so
well
as
brutus
living

follow
the
fortunes

brutus
thorough
the
hazards
of
this
untrod
state
with
all
true
faith
so
says
my
master

wise
and
valiant

wish

may
but
yet
have
i
a
mind
that
fears
him
much
and

misgiving
still

shrewdly
to
the
purpose

beg
not
your
death
of
us
though
now

cruel
as
by
our
hands
and
this
our
present
act
you
see
we
do
yet
see
you
but
our
hands
and
this
the
bleeding
business
they
have
done
our
hearts
you
see
not
they
are
pitiful
and
pity
to
the
general
wrong
of

deed
on

be
patient
till
we
have
appeased
the
multitude
beside
themselves
with
fear
and
then
we
will
deliver
you
the
cause
why

when
i
struck

yours
good
trebonius
gentlemen
all
alas
what
shall
i
say
my
credit
now
stands
on
such
slippery
ground
that
one
of
two
bad
ways
you
must
conceit
me
either
a
coward
or
a
flatterer
that
i
did
love
thee
caesar
o
tis
true
if
then
thy
spirit
look
upon
us
now
shall
it
not
grieve
thee
dearer
than
thy
death
to
see
thy
antony
making
his
peace
shaking
the
bloody
fingers
of
thy
foes
most
noble
in
the
presence
of
thy
corse
had
i
as
many
eyes
as
thou
hast
wounds
weeping
as
fast
as
they
stream
forth
thy
blood
it
would
become
me
better
than
to
close
in
terms
of
friendship
with
thine
enemies
pardon
me
julius
here
wast
thou
bayd
brave
hart
here
didst
thou
fall
and
here
thy
hunters
stand
signd
in
thy
spoil
and
crimsond
in
thy
lethe
o
world
thou
wast
the
forest
to
this
hart
and
this
indeed
o
world
the
heart
of
thee
how
like
a
deer
strucken
by
many
princes
dost
thou
here
lie
cassius
mark
antony
antony
pardon
me
caius
cassius
the
enemies
of
caesar
shall
say
this
then
in
a
friend
it
is
cold
modesty
cassius
i
blame
you
not
for
praising
caesar
so
but
what
compact
mean
you
to
have
with
us
will
you
be
prickd
in
number
of
our
friends
or
shall
we
on
and
not
depend
on
you
antony
therefore
i
took
your
hands
but
was
indeed
swayd
from
the
point
by
looking
down
on
caesar
friends
am
i
with
you
all
and
love
you
all
upon
this
hope
that
you
shall
give
me
reasons
why
and
wherein
caesar
was
dangerous
brutus
or
else
were
this
a
savage
spectacle
our
reasons
are
so
full
of
good
regard
that
were
you
antony
the
son
of
caesar
you
should
be
satisfied
antony
thats
all
i
seek
and
am
moreover
suitor
that
i
may
produce
his
body
to
the
marketplace
and
in
the
pulpit
as
becomes
a
friend
speak
in
the
order
of
his
funeral
brutus
you
shall
mark
antony

word
with
you
aside
to
brutus

know
not
what
you
do
do
not
consent
that
antony
speak
in
his
funeral
know
you
how
much
the
people
may
be
moved
by
that
which
he
will
utter
brutus
by
your
pardon
i
will
myself
into
the
pulpit
first
and
show
the
reason
of
our
caesars
death
what
antony
shall
speak
i
will
protest
he
speaks
by
leave
and
by
permission
and
that
we
are
contented
caesar
shall
have
all
true
rites
and
lawful
ceremonies
it
shall
advantage
more
than
do
us
wrong
cassius
i
know
not
what
may
fall
i
like
it
not
brutus
mark
antony
here
take
you
caesars

you
shall
not
in
your
funeral
speech
blame
us
but
speak
all
good
you
can
devise
of
caesar
and
say
you
dot
by
our
permission
else
shall
you
not
have
any
hand
at
all
about
his
funeral
and
you
shall
speak
in
the
same
pulpit
whereto
i
am
going
after
my
speech
is
ended

if
then
that
friend
demand
why
brutus
rose
against
caesar
this
is
my
answer
not
that
i
loved
caesar
less
but
that
i
loved
rome
more
had
you
rather
caesar
were
living
and
die
all

than
that
caesar
were
dead
to

caesar
loved
me
i
weep
for
him
as
he
was
fortunate
i
rejoice
at
it

was
ambitious
i
slew
him
there
is
tears
for
his
love
joy
for
his

honor
for
his
valor

his
ambition

beholding

us
all
fourth

of
brutus
here
first
citizen
this
caesar
was
a
tyrant
third

nay
thats
certain
we
are
blest
that
rome
is
rid
of
him
second
citizen
peace
let
us
hear
what
antony
can
say
antony
you
gentle
romans
all
peace
ho
let
us
hear
him
antony
friends
romans
countrymen
lend
me
your
ears
i
come
to
bury
caesar
not
to
praise
him
the
evil
that
men
do
lives
after
them
the
good
is
oft
interred
with
their
bones
so
let
it
be
with
caesar
the
noble
brutus
hath
told
you
caesar
was
ambitious
if
it
were
so
it
was
a
grievous
fault
and
grievously
hath
caesar
answerd
it
here
under
leave
of
brutus
and
the
rest
for
brutus
is
an
honorable
man
so
are
they
all
all
honorable
men
come
i
to
speak
in
caesars
funeral
he
was
my
friend
faithful
and
just
to
me
but
brutus
says
he
was
ambitious
and
brutus
is
an
honorable
man
he
hath
brought
many
captives
home
to
rome
whose
ransoms
did
the
general
coffers
fill
did
this
in
caesar
seem
ambitious
when
that
the
poor
have
cried
caesar
hath
wept
ambition
should
be
made
of
sterner
stuff
yet
brutus
says
he
was
ambitious
and
brutus
is
an
honorable
man
you
all
did
see
that
on
the
lupercal
i
thrice
presented
him
a
kingly
crown
which
he
did
thrice
refuse
was
this
ambition
yet
brutus
says
he
was
ambitious
and
sure
he
is
an
honorable
man
i
speak
not
to
disprove
what
brutus
spoke
but
here
i
am
to
speak
what
i
do
know
you
all
did
love
him
once
not
without
cause
what
cause
withholds
you
then
to
mourn
for
him
o
judgement
thou
art
fled
to
brutish
beasts
and
men
have
lost
their
reason
bear
with
me
my
heart
is
in
the
coffin
there
with
caesar
and
i
must
pause
till
it
come
back
to
me
first
citizen
methinks
there
is
much
reason
in
his
sayings
second
citizen
if
thou
consider
rightly
of
the
matter
caesar
has
had
great
wrong
third
citizen
has
he
masters
i
fear
there
will
a
worse
come
in
his
place
fourth
citizen
markd
ye
his
words
he
would
not
take
the
crown
therefore
tis
certain
he
was
not
ambitious
first
citizen
if
it
be
found
so
some
will
dear
abide
it
second
citizen
poor
soul
his
eyes
are
red
as
fire
with
weeping
third
citizen
theres
not
a
nobler
man
in
rome
than
antony
fourth
citizen
now
mark
him
he
begins
again
to
speak
antony
but
yesterday
the
word
of
caesar
might
have
stood
against
the
world
now
lies
he
there
and
none
so
poor
to
do
him
reverence
o
masters
if
i
were
disposed
to
stir
your
hearts
and
minds
to
mutiny
and
rage
i
should
do
brutus
wrong
and
cassius
wrong
who
you
all
know
are
honorable
men
i
will
not
do
them
wrong
i
rather

the
dead
to
wrong
myself
and
you
than
i
will
wrong

burst
his
mighty
heart

in

exit
lepidus
antony
this
is
a
slight
unmeritable
man
meet
to
be
sent
on
errands
is
it
fit
the
threefold
world
divided
he
should
stand
one
of
the
three
to
share
it
octavius
so
you
thought
him
and
took
his
voice
who
should
be
prickd
to
die
in
our
black
sentence
and
proscription
antony
octavius
i
have
seen
more
days
than
you
and
though
we
lay
these
honors
on
this
man
to
ease
ourselves
of
divers
slanderous
loads
he
shall
but
bear
them
as
the
ass
bears
gold
to
groan
and
sweat
under
the
business
either
led
or
driven
as
we
point
the
way
and
having
brought
our
treasure
where
we
will
then
take
we
down
his
load
and
turn
him
off
like
to
the
empty
ass
to
shake
his
ears
and
graze
in
commons
octavius
you
may
do
your
will
but
hes
a
tried
and
valiant
soldier
antony
so
is
my
horse
octavius
and
for
that
i
do
appoint
him
store
of
provender
it
is
a
creature
that
i
teach
to
fight
to
wind
to
stop
to
run
directly
on
his
corporal
motion
governd
by
my
spirit
and
in
some
taste
is
lepidus
but
so
he
must
be
taught
and
traind
and
bid
go
forth
a
barrenspirited
fellow
one
that
feeds
on
objects
arts
and
imitations
which
out
of
use
and
staled
by
other
men
begin
his
fashion
do
not
talk
of
him
but
as
a
property
and
now
octavius
listen
great
things
brutus
and
cassius
are
levying
powers
we
must
straight
make
head
therefore
let
our
alliance
be
combined
our
best
friends
made
our
means
stretchd
and
let
us
presently
go
sit
in
council
how
covert
matters
may
be
best
disclosed
and
open
perils
surest
answered
octavius
let
us
do
so
for
we
are
at
the
stake
and
bayd
about
with
many
enemies
and
some
that
smile
have
in
their
hearts
i
fear
millions
of
mischiefs

enter
brutus
and
cassius

cassius
that
you
have
wrongd
me
doth
appear
in
this
you
have
condemnd
and
noted
lucius
pella
for
taking
bribes
here
of
the
sardians
wherein
my
letters
praying
on
his
side
because
i
knew
the
man
were
slighted
off
brutus
you
wrongd
yourself
to
write
in
such
a
case
cassius
in
such
a
time
as
this
it
is
not
meet
that
every
nice
offense
should
bear
his
comment
brutus
let
me
tell
you
cassius
you
yourself
are
much
condemnd
to
have
an
itching
palm
to
sell
and
mart
your
offices
for
gold
to
undeservers
cassius
i
an
itching
palm
you
know
that
you
are
brutus
that
speaks
this
or
by
the

else
your
last
brutus

honors
this
corruption
and
chastisement
doth
therefore
hide

cassius
chastisement
brutus
remember

ides
of

remember
did
not
great
julius
bleed
for
justice
sake
what
villain
touchd
his
body
that
did
stab
and
not
for
justice
what
shall
one
of
us
that
struck
the
foremost
man
of
all
this
world
but
for
supporting
robbers
shall
we
now
contaminate
our
fingers
with
base
bribes
and
sell
the
mighty
space
of
our
large
honors
for
so
much
trash
as
may
be
grasped
thus
i
had
rather

i
shall
be
glad
to
learn
of
noble
men
cassius
you

me
every
way
you
wrong
me
brutus
i
said
an
elder
soldier
not
a
better

better
brutus
if
you
did
i
care
not
cassius
when
caesar
lived
he
durst
not
thus
have
moved
me
brutus
peace
peace
you
durst
not
so
have
tempted
him
cassius
i
durst
not
brutus
no
cassius
what
durst
not
tempt
him
brutus
for
your
life
you
durst
not
cassius
do
not
presume
too
much
upon
my
love
i
may
do
that
i
shall
be
sorry
for
brutus
you
have
done
that
you
should
be
sorry
for
there
is
no
terror
cassius
in
your
threats
for
i
am
armd
so
strong
in
honesty
that
they
pass
by
me
as
the
idle
wind
which
i
respect
not
i
did
send
to
you
for
certain
sums
of
gold
which
you
denied
me
for
i
can
raise
no
money
by
vile
means
by
heaven
i
had
rather
coin
my
heart
and
drop
my
blood
for
drachmas
than
to
wring
from
the
hard
hands
of
peasants
their
vile
trash
by
any
indirection
i
did
send
to
you
for
gold
to
pay
my
legions
which
you
denied
me
was
that
done
like
cassius
should
i
have
answerd
caius
cassius
so
when
marcus
brutus
grows
so
covetous
to
lock
such
rascal
counters
from
his
friends
be
ready
gods
with
all
your
thunderbolts
dash
him
to
pieces
cassius
i
denied
you
not
brutus
you
did
cassius
i
did
not
he
was
but
a
fool
that
brought
my
answer
back
brutus
hath
rived
my
heart
a
friend
should
bear
his
friends
infirmities
but
brutus
makes
mine
greater
than
they
are
brutus
i
do
not
till
you
practise
them
on
me
cassius
you
love
me
not
brutus
i
do
not
like
your
faults
cassius
a
friendly
eye
could
never
see
such
faults
brutus
a
flatterers
would
not
though
they
do
appear
as
huge
as
high
olympus
cassius
come
antony
and
young
octavius
come
revenge
yourselves
alone
on
cassius
for
cassius
is
aweary
of
the
world
hated
by
one
he
loves
braved
by
his
brother
checkd
like
a
bondman
all
his
faults
observed
set
in
a
notebook
learnd
and
connd
by
rote
to
cast
into
my
teeth
o
i
could
weep
my
spirit
from
mine
eyes
there
is
my
dagger
and
here
my
naked
breast
within
a
heart
dearer
than
plutos
mine
richer
than
gold
if
that
thou
best
a
roman
take
it
forth
i
that
denied
thee
gold
will
give
my
heart
strike
as
thou
didst
at
caesar
for
i
know
when
thou
didst
hate
him
worst
thou
lovedst
him
better
than
ever
thou
lovedst
cassius
brutus
sheathe
your
dagger

angry
when
you
will
it

have
scope
do
what
you
will
dishonor
shall
be

o
cassius
you
are
yoked
with
a
lamb
that
carries
anger
as
the
flint
bears
fire
who
much
enforced
shows
a
hasty
spark
and
straight
is
cold
again
cassius
hath
cassius
lived
to
be
but
mirth
and
laughter
to
his
brutus
when
grief
and

illtemperd

that
by

of

octavius
antony
and
lepidus
have
put
to
death
an
hundred
senators

that
died
by
their

cassius
cicero
one
messala
cicero

no
messala
messala

nothing
in

writ
of
her

messala
no
my
lord
brutus
now
as
you
are

messala
then
like
a
roman
bear
the
truth
i
tell
for
certain
she
is
dead
and
by
strange
manner
brutus
why
farewell
portia
we
must
die
messala
with
meditating
that
she
must
die
once
i
have
the
patience
to
endure
it
now
messala
even
so
great
men
great
losses
should
endure
cassius
i
have
as
much
of
this
in

as
you
but
yet
my
nature
could
not
bear
it
so
brutus
well
to
our
work
alive
what
do
you
think
of
marching
to
philippi
presently
cassius
i
do
not
think
it
good
brutus
your
reason
cassius
this
it
is
tis
better
that
the
enemy
seek
us
so
shall
he
waste
his
means
weary
his
soldiers
doing
himself
offense
whilst
we
lying
still
are
full
of
rest
defense
and
nimbleness
brutus
good
reasons
must
of
force
give
place
to
better
the
people
twixt
philippi
and
this
ground
do
stand
but
in
a
forced
affection
for
they
have
grudged
us
contribution
the
enemy
marching
along
by
them
by
them
shall
make
a
fuller
number
up
come
on
refreshd
newadded
and
encouraged
from
which
advantage
shall
we
cut
him
off
if
at
philippi
we
do
face
him
there
these
people
at
our
back
cassius
hear
me
good
brother
brutus
under
your
pardon
you
must
note
beside
that
we
have
tried
the
utmost
of
our
friends
our
legions
are
brimfull
our
cause
is
ripe
the
enemy
increaseth
every
day
we
at
the
height
are
ready
to
decline
there
is
a
tide
in
the
affairs
of
men
which
taken
at
the
flood
leads
on
to
fortune
omitted
all
the
voyage
of
their
life
is
bound
in
shallows
and
in
miseries
on
such
a
full
sea
are
we
now
afloat
and
we
must
take
the
current
when
it
serves
or
lose
our
ventures
cassius
then
with
your
will
go
on
well
along
ourselves
and
meet
them
at
philippi
brutus
the
deep
of
night
is
crept
upon
our
talk
and
nature
must
obey
necessity
which
we
will
niggard
with
a
little
rest
there

our
hopes
are
answered
you
said
the
enemy
would
not
come
down
but
keep
the
hills
and
upper
regions
it
proves
not
so
their
battles
are
at
hand
they
mean
to
warn
us
at
philippi
here
answering
before
we
do
demand
of
them
antony
tut
i
am
in
their
bosoms
and
i
know
wherefore
they
do
it
they
could
be
content
to
visit
other
places
and
come
down
with
fearful
bravery
thinking
by
this
face
to
fasten
in
our
thoughts
that
they
have
courage
but
tis
not
so

enter
a
messenger

shall
we
give
sign
of
battle
antony
no
caesar
we
will
answer
on
their
charge
make
forth
the
generals
would
have
some
words
octavius
stir
not
until
the
signal
not
until
the
signal
brutus
words
before
blows
is
it
so
countrymen
octavius
not
that
we
love
words
better
as
you
do
brutus
good
words
are
better
than
bad
strokes
octavius
antony
in
your
bad
strokes
brutus
you
give
good
words
witness
the
hole
you
made
in
caesars
heart
crying
long
live
hail
caesar
cassius
antony
the
posture
of
your
blows
are
yet
unknown
but
for
your
words
they
rob
the
hybla
bees
and
leave
them
honeyless
antony
not
stingless
too
brutus
o
yes
and
soundless
too
for
you
have
stoln
their
buzzing
antony
and
very
wisely
threat
before
you
sting
antony
villains
you
did
not
so
when
your
vile
daggers
hackd
one
another
in
the
sides
of
caesar
you
showd
your
teeth
like
apes
and
fawnd
like
hounds
and
bowd
like
bondmen
kissing
caesars
feet
whilst
damned
casca
like
a
cur
behind
strooke
caesar
on
the
neck
o
you
flatterers
cassius
flatterers
now
brutus
thank
yourself
this
tongue
had
not
offended
so
today
if
cassius
might
have
ruled
octavius
come
come
the
cause
if
arguing
make
us
sweat
the
proof
of
it
will
turn
to
redder
drops
look
i
draw
a
sword
against
conspirators
when
think
you
that
the
sword
goes
up
again
never
till
caesars
three
and
thirty
wounds
be
well
avenged
or
till
another
caesar
have
added
slaughter
to
the
sword
of
traitors
brutus
caesar
thou
canst
not
die
by
traitors
hands
unless
thou
bringst
them
with
thee
octavius
so
i
hope
i
was
not
born
to
die
on
brutus
sword
brutus
o
if
thou
wert
the
noblest
of
thy
strain
young
man
thou
couldst
not
die
more
honorable
cassius
a
peevish
school
boy
worthless
of
such
honor
joind
with
a
masker
and
a
reveler
antony
old
cassius
still
octavius
come
antony
away
defiance
traitors
hurl
we
in
your
teeth
if
you
dare
fight
today
come
to
the
field
if
not
when
you
have
stomachs
exeunt
octavius
antony
and
their
army
cassius
why
now
blow
and
swell
billow
and
swim
bark
the
storm
is
up
and
all
is
on
the
hazard
brutus
ho
lucilius
hark
a
word
with
you
lucilius
stands
forth
my
lord
brutus
and
lucilius
converse
apart
cassius
messala
messala
stands
forth
what
says
my
general
cassius
messala
this
is
my
birthday
as
this
very
day
was
cassius
born
give
me
thy
hand
messala
be
thou
my
witness
that
against
my
will
as
pompey
was
am
i
compelld
to
set
upon
one
battle
all
our
liberties
you
know
that
i
held
epicurus
strong
and
his
opinion
now
i
change
my
mind
and
partly
credit
things
that
do
presage
coming
from
sardis
on
our
former
ensign
two
mighty
eagles
fell
and
there
they
perchd
gorging
and
feeding
from
our
soldiers
hands
who
to
philippi
here
consorted
us
this
morning
are
they
fled
away
and
gone
and
in
their
steads
do
ravens
crows
and
kites
fly
oer
our
heads
and
downward
look
on
us
as
we
were
sickly
prey
their
shadows
seem
a
canopy
most
fatal
under
which
our
army
lies
ready
to
give
up
the
ghost
messala
believe
not
so
cassius
i
but
believe
it
partly
for
i
am
fresh
of
spirit
and
resolved
to
meet
all
perils
very
constantly
brutus
even
so
lucilius
cassius
now
most
noble
brutus
the
gods
today
stand
friendly
that
we
may
lovers
in
peace
lead
on
our
days
to
age
but
since
the
affairs
of
men
rest
still
incertain
lets
reason
with
the
worst
that
may
befall
if
we
do
lose
this
battle
then
is
this
the
very
last
time
we
shall
speak
together
what
are
you
then
determined
to
do
brutus
even
by
the
rule
of
that
philosophy
by
which
i
did
blame
cato
for
the
death
which
he
did
give
himself
i
know
not
how
but
i
do
find
it
cowardly
and
vile
for
fear
of
what
might
fall
so
to
prevent
the
time
of
life
arming
myself
with
patience
to
stay
the
providence
of
some
high
powers
that
govern
us
below
cassius
then
if
we
lose
this
battle
you
are
contented
to
be
led
in
triumph
thorough
the
streets
of
rome
brutus
no
cassius
no
think
not
thou
noble
roman
that
ever
brutus
will
go
bound
to
rome
he
bears
too
great
a
mind
but
this
same
day
must
end
that
work
the
ides
of
march
begun
and
whether
we
shall
meet
again
i
know
not
therefore
our
everlasting
farewell
take
forever
and
forever
farewell
cassius
if
we
do
meet
again
why
we
shall
smile
if
not
why
then
this
parting
was
well
made
cassius
forever
and
forever
farewell
brutus
if
we
do
meet
again
well
smile
indeed
if
not
tis
true
this
parting
was
well
made
brutus
why
then
lead
on
o
that
a
man
might
know
the
end
of
this
days
business
ere
it
come
but
it
sufficeth
that
the
day
will
end
and
then
the
end
is
known
come
ho
away

that
even

now
was
your

object
the
argument
of

so
monstrous
to

so
many
folds
of

sure
her
offence
must
be
of
such
unnatural
degree
that
monsters
it
or
your
forevouchd
affection
falln
into
taint
which
to
believe
of
her
must
be
a
faith
that
reason
without
miracle
should
never
plant
in
me
cor
i
yet
beseech
your

if
for
i

that
glib
and
oily

to

since
what
i
well
intend

that
you
make
known
it
is
no
vicious
blot
murther
or
foulness
no
unchaste
action
or
dishonoured
step
that
hath
deprivd
me
of

even
for
want
of

for
which
i
am
richer
a
stillsoliciting

and
such
a

as
i

glad
