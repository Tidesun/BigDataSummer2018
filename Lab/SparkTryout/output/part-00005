won
her
soul
and
she
sweet
lady
dotes
devoutly
dotes
dotes
in
idolatry
upon
this
spotted
and
inconstant
man
theseus
i
must
confess
that
i
have
heard
so
much
and
with
demetrius
thought
to
have
spoke
thereof
but
being
overfull
of
selfaffairs
my
mind
did
lose
it
but
demetrius
come
and
come
egeus
you
shall
go
with
me
i
have
some
private
schooling
for
you
both
for
you
fair
hermia
look
you
arm
yourself
to
fit
your
fancies
to
your
fathers
will
or
else
the
law
of
athens
yields
you
up
which
by
no
means
we
may
extenuate
to
death
or
to
a
vow
of
single
life
come
my
hippolyta
what
cheer
my
love
demetrius
and
egeus
go
along
i
must
employ
you
in
some
business
against
our
nuptial
and
confer
with
you
of
something
nearly
that
concerns
yourselves
egeus
with
duty
and
desire
we
follow
you
exeunt
all
but
lysander
and
hermia
lysander
how
now
my
love
why
is
your
cheek
so
pale
how
chance
the
roses
there
do
fade
so
fast
hermia
belike
for
want
of
rain
which
i
could
well
beteem
them
from
the
tempest
of
my
eyes
lysander
ay
me
for
aught
that
i
could
ever
read
could
ever
hear
by
tale
or
history
the
course
of
true
love
never
did
run
smooth
but
either
it
was
different
in
blood
hermia
o
cross
too
high
to
be
enthralld
to
low
lysander
or
else
misgraffed
in
respect
of
years
hermia
o
spite
too
old
to
be
engagd
to
young
lysander
or
else
it
stood
upon
the
choice
of
friends
hermia
o
hell
to
choose
love
by
anothers
eyes
lysander
or
if
there
were
a
sympathy
in
choice
war
death
or
sickness
did
lay
siege
to
it
making
it
momentary
as
a
sound
swift
as
a
shadow
short
as
any
dream
brief
as
the
lightning
in
the
collied
night
that
in
a
spleen
unfolds
both
heaven
and
earth
and
ere
a
man
hath
power
to
say
behold
the
jaws
of
darkness
do
devour
it
up
so
quick
bright
things
come
to
confusion
hermia
if
then
true
lovers
have
ever
crossd
it
stands
as
an
edict
in
destiny
then
let
us
teach
our
trial
patience
because
it
is
a
customary
cross
as
due
to
love
as
thoughts
and
dreams
and
sighs
wishes
and
tears
poor
fancys
followers
lysander
a
good
persuasion
therefore
hear
me
hermia
i
have
a
widow
aunt
a
dowager
of
great
revenue
and
she
hath
no
child
from
athens
is
her
house
remote
seven
leagues
and
she
respects
me
as
her
only
son
there
gentle
hermia
may
i
marry
thee
and
to
that
place
the
sharp
athenian
law
cannot
pursue
us
if
thou
lovest
me
then
steal
forth
thy
fathers
house
tomorrow
night
and
in
the
wood
a
league
without
the
town
where

meet
thee
once
with
helena
to
do
observance
to
a
morn
of
may
there
will
i
stay
for
thee
hermia
my
good
lysander
i
swear
to
thee
by
cupids
strongest
bow
by
his
best
arrow
with
the
golden
head
by
the
simplicity
of
venus
doves
by
that
which
knitteth
souls
and
prospers
loves
and
by
that
fire
which
burnd
the
carthage
queen
when
the
false
troyan
under
sail
was
seen
by
all
the
vows
that
ever
men
have
broke
in
number
more
than
ever

your

the
motion
of

that
your

would
teach

such
skill
hermia
i
give

curses
yet
he
gives

his

were
mine
hermia
take
comfort
he
no

and
myself
will
fly
this
place
before
the
time
i
did
lysander
see
seemd
athens
as
a
paradise
to
me
o
then
what
graces
in
my
love
do
dwell
that
he
hath
turnd
a
heaven
unto
a
hell
lysander
helen
to
you
our
minds
we
will
unfold
tomorrow
night
when
phoebe
doth
behold
her
silver
visage
in
the
watry
glass
decking
with
liquid
pearl
the
bladed
grass
a
time
that
lovers
flights
doth
still
conceal
through
athens
gates
have
we
devisd
to
steal
hermia
and
in
the
wood
where
often
you
and
i
upon
faint
primrose
beds
were
wont
to
lie
emptying
our
bosoms
of
their
counsel
sweet
there
my
lysander
and
myself
shall
meet
and
thence
from
athens
turn
away
our
eyes
to
seek
new
friends
and
stranger
companies
farewell
sweet
playfellow
pray
thou
for
us
and
good
luck
grant
thee
thy
demetrius
keep
word
lysander
we
must
starve
our
sight
from
lovers
food
till
morrow
deep
midnight
lysander
i
will
my
hermia
exit
hermia
helena
adieu
as
you
on
him
demetrius
dote
on
you


















exit
helena
how
happy
some
oer
other
some
can
be
through
athens
i
am
thought
as
fair
as
she
but
what
of
that
demetrius
thinks
not
so
he
will
not
know
what
all
but
he
do
know
and
as
he
errs
doting
on
hermias
eyes
so
i
admiring
of
his
qualities
things
base
and
vile
holding
no
quantity
love
can
transpose
to
form
and
dignity
love
looks
not
with
the
eyes
but
with
the
mind
and
therefore
is
wingd
cupid
painted
blind
nor
hath
loves
mind
of
any
judgment
taste
wings
and
no
eyes
figure
unheedy
haste
and
therefore
is
love
said
to
be
a
child
because
in
choice
he
is
so
oft
beguild
as
waggish
boys
in
game
themselves
forswear
so
the
boy
love
is
perjurd
everywhere
for
ere
demetrius
lookd
on
hermias
eyne
he
haild
down
oaths
that
he
was
only
mine
and
when
this
hail
some
heat
from
hermia
felt
so
he
dissolvd
and
showrs
of
oaths
did
melt
i
will
go
tell
him
of
fair
hermias
flight
then
to
the
wood
will
he
tomorrow
night
pursue
her
and
for
this
intelligence
if
i
have
thanks
it
is
a
dear
expense
but
herein
mean
i
to
enrich
my
pain
to
have
his
sight
thither
and
back
again

enter

at

with
his

and
titania
at
another
with
hers

oberon
ill
met
by
moonlight
proud
titania
titania
what
jealous
oberon
fairies
skip
hence
i
have
forsworn
his
bed
and
company
oberon
tarry
rash
wanton
am
not
i
thy
lord
titania
then
i
must
be
thy
lady
but
i
know
when
thou
hast
stolen
away
from
fairy
land
and
in
the
shape
of
corin
sat
all
day
playing
on
pipes
of
corn
and
versing
love
to
amorous
phillida
why
art
thou
here
come
from
the
farthest
steep
of
india
but
that
forsooth
the
bouncing
amazon
your
buskind
mistress
and
your
warrior
love
to
theseus
must
be
wedded
and
you
come
to
give
their
bed
joy
and
prosperity
oberon
how
canst
thou
thus
for
shame
titania
glance
at
my
credit
with
hippolyta
knowing
i
know
thy
love
to
theseus
didst
not
thou
lead
him
through
the
glimmering
night
from
perigouna
whom
he
ravished
and
make
him
with
fair
aegles
break
his
faith
with
ariadne
and
antiopa
titania
these
are
the
forgeries
of
jealousy
and
never
since
the
middle
summers
spring
met
we
on
hill
in
dale
forest
or
mead
by
paved
fountain
or
by
rushy
brook
or
in
the
beached
margent
of
the
sea
to
dance
our
ringlets
to
the
whistling
wind
but
with
thy
brawls
thou
hast
disturbd
our
sport
therefore
the
winds
piping
to
us
in
vain
as
in
revenge
have
suckd
up
from
the
sea
contagious
fogs
which
falling
in
the
land
hath
every
pelting
river
made
so
proud
that
they
have
overborne
their
continents
the
ox
hath
therefore
stretchd
his
yoke
in
vain
the
ploughman
lost
his
sweat
and
the
green
corn
hath
rotted
ere
his
youth
attaind
a
beard
the
fold
stands
empty
in
the
drowned
field
and
crows
are
fatted
with
the
murrion
flock
the
nine
mens
morris
is
filld
up
with
mud
and
the
quaint
mazes
in
the
wanton
green
for
lack
of
tread
are
undistinguishable
the
human
mortals
want
their
winter
here
no
night
is
now
with
hymn
or
carol
blest
therefore
the
moon
the
governess
of
floods
pale
in
her
anger
washes
all
the
air
that
rheumatic
diseases
do
abound
and
thorough
this
distemperature
we
see
the
seasons
alter
hoaryheaded
frosts
fall
in
the
fresh
lap
of
the
crimson
rose
and
on
old
hiems
thin
and
icy
crown
an
odorous
chaplet
of
sweet
summer
buds
is
as
in
mockery
set
the
spring
the
summer
the
childing
autumn
angry
winter
change
their
wonted
liveries
and
the
mazed
world
by
their
increase
now
knows
not
which
is
which
and
this
same
progeny
of
evils
comes
from
our
debate
from
our
dissension
we
are
their
parents
and
original
oberon
do
you
amend
it
then
it
lies
in
you
why
should
titania
cross
her
oberon
i
do
but
beg
a
little
changeling
boy
to
be
my
henchman
titania
set
your
heart
at
rest
the
fairy
land
buys
not
the
child
of
me
his
mother
was
a
votress
of
my
order
and
in
the
spiced
indian
air
by
night
full
often
hath
she
gossipd
by
my
side
and
sat
with
me
on
neptunes
yellow
sands
marking
th
embarked
traders
on
the
flood
when
we
have
laughd
to
see
the
sails
conceive
and
grow
bigbellied
with
the
wanton
wind
which
she
with
pretty
and
with
swimming
gait
following
her
womb
then
rich
with
my
young
squire
would
imitate
and
sail
upon
the
land
to
fetch
me
trifles
and
return
again
as
from
a
voyage
rich
with
merchandise
but
she
being
mortal
of
that
boy
did
die

for
her
sake
do
i
rear
up
her
boy

the
lesser
is
my
grace
happy
is
hermia
wheresoeer
she
lies
for
she
hath
blessed
and
attractive
eyes
how
came
her
eyes
so
bright
not
with
salt
tears
if
so
my
eyes
are
oftner
washd
than
hers
no
no
i
am
as
ugly
as
a
bear
for
beasts
that
meet
me
run
away
for
fear
therefore
no
marvel
though
demetrius
do
as
a
monster
fly
my
presence
thus
what
wicked
and
dissembling
glass
of
mine
made
me
compare
with
hermias
sphery
eyne
but
who
is
here
lysander
on
the
ground
dead
or
asleep
i
see
no
blood
no
wound
lysander
if
you
live
good
sir
awake
lysander
waking
and
run
through
fire
i
will
for
thy
sweet
sake
transparent
helena
nature
shows
art
that
through
thy
bosom
makes
me
see
thy
heart
where
is
demetrius
o
how
fit
a
word
is
that
vile
name
to
perish
on
my
sword
helena
do
not
say
so
lysander
say
not
so
what
though
he
love
your
hermia
lord
what
though
yet
hermia
still
loves
you
then
be
content
lysander
content
with
hermia
no
i
do
repent
the
tedious
minutes
i
with
her
have
spent
not
hermia
but
helena
i
love
who
will
not
change
a
raven
for
a
dove
the
will
of
man
is
by
his
reason
swayd
and
reason
says
you
are
the
worthier
maid
things
growing
are
not
ripe
until
their
season
so
i
being
young
till
now
ripe
not
to
reason
and
touching
now
the
point
of
human
skill
reason
becomes
the
marshal
to
my
will
and
leads
me
to
your
eyes
where
i
oerlook
loves
stories
written
in
loves
richest
book
helena
wherefore
was
i
to
this
keen
mockery
born
when
at
your
hands
did
i
deserve
this
scorn
ist
not
enough
ist
not
enough
young
man
that
i
did
never
no
nor
never
can
deserve
a
sweet
look
from
demetrius
eye
but
you
must
flout
my
insufficiency
good
troth
you
do
me
wrong
good
sooth
you
do
in
such
disdainful
manner
me
to
woo
but
fare
you
well
perforce
i
must
confess
i
thought
you
lord
of
more
true
gentleness
o
that
a
lady
of
one
man
refusd
should
of
another
therefore
be
abusd

a

convenient

quince
quince
what
sayest
thou
bully
bottom
bottom
there
are
things
in
this
comedy
of
pyramus
and
thisby
that
will
never
please
first
pyramus
must
draw
a
sword
to
kill
himself
which
the
ladies
cannot
abide
how
answer
you
that
snout
byr
lakin
a
parlous
fear
starveling
i
believe
we
must
leave
the
killing
out
when
all
is
done
bottom
not
a
whit
i
have
a
device
to
make
all
well
write
me
a
prologue
and
let
the
prologue
seem
to
say
we
will
do
no
harm
with
our
swords
and
that
pyramus
is
not
killd
indeed
and
for
the
more
better
assurance
tell
them
that
i
pyramus
am
not
pyramus
but
bottom
the
weaver
this
will
put
them
out
of
fear
quince
well
we
will
have
such
a
prologue
and
it
shall
be
written
in
eight
and
six
bottom
no
make

more
let
it
be
written
in

will
not
the

be
afeard

the
lion
starveling
i
fear

promise
you
bottom
masters
you
ought
to
consider
with
yourself
to
bring
in
god
shield
us
a
lion
among
ladies
is
a
most
dreadful
thing
for
there
is
not
a
more
fearful
wildfowl
than
your
lion
living
and
we
ought
to
look
tot
snout
therefore
another
prologue
must
tell
he
is
not
a
lion
bottom
nay
you
must
name
his
name
and
half
his
face
must
be
seen
through
the
lions
neck
and
he
himself
must
speak
through
saying
thus
or
to
the
same
defect
ladies
or
fair
ladies
i
would
wish
you
or
i
would
request
you
or
i
would
entreat
you
not
to
fear
not
to
tremble
my
life
for
yours
if
you
think
i
come
hither
as
a
lion
it
were
pity
of
my
life
no
i
am
no
such
thing
i
am
a
man
as
other
men
are
and
there
indeed
let

name
his
name
and
tell
them
plainly
he
is
snug
the
joiner

dull

sleeping
hour
a
crew
of
patches
rude
mechanicals
that
work
for
bread
upon
athenian
stalls
were
met
together
to
rehearse
a
play
intended
for
great
theseus
nuptial
day
the
shallowest
thickskin
of
that
barren
sort
who
pyramus
presented
in
their
sport
forsook
his
scene
and
entred
in
a
brake
when
i
did
him
at
this
advantage
take
an
asss
nole
i
fixed
on
his
head
anon

themselves

this
seal
of

helena
o
spite
o
hell
i
see
you
all
are
bent
to
set
against
me
for
your
merriment
if
you
were
civil
and
knew
courtesy
you
would
not
do
me
thus
much
injury
can
you
not
hate
me
as
i
know
you
do
but
you
must
join
in
souls
to
mock
me
too
if
you
were
men
as
men
you
are
in
show
you
would
not
use
a
gentle
lady
so
to
vow
and
swear
and
superpraise
my
parts
when
i
am
sure
you
hate
me
with
your
hearts
you
both
are
rivals
and
love
hermia
and
now
both
rivals
to
mock
helena
a
trim
exploit
a
manly
enterprise
to
conjure
tears
up
in
a
poor
maids
eyes
with
your
derision
none
of
noble
sort
would
so
offend
a
virgin
and
extort
a
poor
souls
patience
all
to
make
you
sport
lysander
you
are
unkind
demetrius
be
not
so
for
you
love
hermia
this
you
know
i
know
and
here
with
all
good
will
with
all
my
heart
in
hermias
love
i
yield
you
up
my
part
and
yours
of
helena
to
me
bequeath
whom
i
do
love
and
will
do
till
my
death
helena
never
did
mockers
waste
more
idle
breath
demetrius
lysander
keep
thy
hermia
i
will
none
if
eer
i
lovd
her
all
that
love
is
gone
my
heart
to
her
but
as
guestwise
sojournd
and
now
to

is
it

returnd
there
to

it
is
not

enter
hermia

hermia
dark
night
that
from
the
eye
his
function
takes
the
ear
more
quick
of
apprehension
makes
wherein
it
doth
impair
the
seeing
sense
it
pays
the
hearing
double
recompense
thou
art
not
by
mine
eye
lysander
found
mine
ear
i
thank
it
brought
me
to
thy
sound
but
why
unkindly
didst
thou
leave
me
so
lysander
why
should
he
stay
whom
love
doth
press
to
go
hermia
what
love
could
press
lysander
from
my
side
lysander
lysanders
love
that
would
not
let
him
bide
fair
helena
who
more
engilds
the
night
than
all
yon
fiery
oes
and
eyes
of
light
why
seekst
thou
me
could
not
this
make
thee
know
the
hate
i
bare
thee
made
me
leave
thee
so
hermia
you
speak
not
as
you
think
it
cannot
be
helena
lo
she
is
one
of
this
confederacy
now
i
perceive
they
have
conjoind
all
three
to
fashion
this
false
sport
in
spite
of
me
injurious
hermia
most
ungrateful
maid
have
you
conspird
have
you
with
these
contrivd
to
bait
me
with
this
foul
derision
is
all
the
counsel
that
we
two
have
shard
the
sisters
vows
the
hours
that
we
have
spent
when
we
have
chid
the
hastyfooted
time
for
parting
us
o
is
all
forgot
all
schooldays
friendship
childhood
innocence
we
hermia
like
two
artificial
gods
have
with
our
needles
created
both
one
flower
both
on
one
sampler
sitting
on
one
cushion
both
warbling
of
one
song
both
in
one
key
as
if
our
hands
our
sides
voices
and
minds
had
been
incorporate
so
we
grew
together
like
to
a
double
cherry
seeming
parted
but
yet
an
union
in
partition
two
lovely
berries
moulded
on
one
stern
so
with
two
seeming
bodies
but
one
heart
two
of
the
first
like
coats
in
heraldry
due
but
to
one
and
crowned
with
one
crest
and
will
you
rent
our
ancient
love
asunder
to
join
with
men
in
scorning
your
poor
friend
it
is
not
friendly
tis
not
maidenly
our
sex
as
well
as
i
may
chide
you
for
it
though
i
alone
do
feel
the
injury
hermia
i
am
amazed
at
your
passionate
words
i
scorn
you
not
it
seems
that
you
scorn
me
helena
have
you
not
set
lysander
as
in
scorn
to
follow
me
and
praise
my
eyes
and
face
and
made
your
other
love
demetrius
who
even
but
now
did
spurn
me
with
his
foot
to
call
me
goddess
nymph
divine
and
rare
precious
celestial
wherefore
speaks
he
this
to
her
he
hates
and
wherefore
doth
lysander
deny
your
love
so
rich
within
his
soul
and
tender
me
forsooth
affection
but
by
your
setting
on
by
your
consent
what
though
i
be
not
so
in
grace
as
you
so
hung
upon
with
love
so
fortunate
but
miserable
most
to
love
unlovd
this
you
should
pity
rather
than
despise
hermia
i
understand
not
what
you
mean
by
this
helena
ay
do
persever
counterfeit
sad
looks
make
mouths
upon
me
when
i
turn
my
back
wink
each
at
other
hold
the
sweet
jest
up
this
sport
well
carried
shall
be
chronicled
if
you
have
any
pity
grace
or
manners
you
would
not
make
me
such
an
argument
but
fare
ye
well
tis
partly
my
own
fault
which
death
or
absence
soon
shall
remedy
lysander
stay
gentle
helena
hear
my
excuse
my
love
my
life
my
soul
fair
helena
helena
o
excellent
hermia
sweet
do
not
scorn
her
so
demetrius
if
she
cannot
entreat
i
can
compel
lysander
thou
canst
compel
no
more
than
she
entreat
thy
threats
have
no
more
strength
than
her
weak
prayers
helen
i
love
thee
by
my
life
i
do
i
swear
by
that
which
i
will
lose
for
thee
to
prove
him
false
that
says
i
love
thee
not
demetrius
i
say
i
love
thee
more
than
he
can
do
lysander
if
thou
say
so
withdraw
and
prove
it
too
demetrius
quick
come
hermia
lysander
whereto
tends
all
this
lysander
away
you
ethiope
demetrius
no
no
he
will
seem
to
break
loose
take
on
as
you
would
follow
but
yet
come
not
you
are
a
tame
man
go
lysander
hang
off
thou
cat
thou
burr
vile
thing
let
loose
or
i
will
shake
thee
from
me
like
a
serpent
hermia
why
are
you
grown
so
rude
what
change
is
this
sweet
love
lysander
thy
love
out
tawny
tartar
out
out
loathed
medcine
o
hated
potion
hence
hermia
do
you
not
jest
helena
yes
sooth
and
so
do
you
lysander
demetrius
i
will
keep
my
word
with
thee
demetrius
i
would
i
had
your
bond
for
i
perceive
a
weak
bond
holds
you
ill
not
trust
your
word
lysander
what
should
i
hurt
her
strike
her
kill
her
dead
although
i
hate
her
ill
not
harm
her
so
hermia
what
can
you
do
me
greater
harm
than
hate
hate
me
wherefore
o
me
what
news
my
love
am
not
i
hermia
are
not
you
lysander
i
am
as
fair
now
as
i
was
erewhile
since
night
you
lovd
me
yet
since
night
you
left
me
why
then
you
left
me
o
the
gods
forbid
in
earnest
shall
i
say
lysander
ay
by
my
life
and
never
did
desire
to
see
thee
more
therefore
be
out
of
hope
of
question
of
doubt
be
certain
nothing
truer
tis
no
jest
that
i
do
hate
thee
and
love
helena
hermia
o
me
you
juggler
you
cankerblossom
you
thief
of
love
what
have
you
come
by
night
and
stoln
my
loves
heart
from
him
helena
fine
i
faith
have
you
no
modesty
no
maiden
shame
no
touch
of
bashfulness
what
will
you
tear
impatient
answers
from
my
gentle
tongue
fie
fie
you
counterfeit
you
puppet
you
hermia
puppet
why
so
ay
that
way
goes
the
game
now
i
perceive
that
she
hath
made
compare
between
our
statures
she
hath
urgd
her
height
and
with
her
personage
her
tall
personage
her
height
forsooth
she
hath
prevaild
with
him
and
are
you
grown
so
high
in
his
esteem
because
i
am
so
dwarfish
and
so
low
how
low
am
i
thou
painted
maypole
speak
how
low
am
i
i
am
not
yet
so
low
but
that
my
nails
can
reach
unto
thine
eyes
helena
i
pray
you
though
you
mock
me
gentlemen
let
her
not
hurt
me
i
was
never
curst
i
have
no
gift
at
all
in
shrewishness
i
am
a
right
maid
for
my
cowardice
let
her
not
strike
me
you
perhaps
may
think
because
she
is
something
lower
than
myself
that
i
can
match
her
hermia
lower
hark
again
helena
good
hermia
do
not
be
so
bitter
with
me
i
evermore
did
love
you
hermia
did
ever
keep
your
counsels
never
wrongd
you
save
that
in
love
unto
demetrius
i
told
him
of
your
stealth
unto
this
wood
he
followed
you
for
love
i
followed
him
but
he
hath
chid
me
hence
and
threatned
me
to
strike
me
spurn
me
nay
to
kill
me
too
and
now
so
you
will
let
me
quiet
go
to
athens
will
i
bear
my
folly
back
and
follow
you
no
further
let
me
go
you
see
how
simple
and
how
fond
i
am
hermia
why
get
you
gone
who
ist
that
hinders
you
helena
a
foolish
heart
that
i
leave
here
behind
hermia
what
with
lysander
helena
with
demetrius
lysander
be
not
afraid
she
shall
not
harm
thee
helena
demetrius
no
sir
she
shall
not
though
you
take
her
part
helena
o
when
she
is
angry
she
is
keen
and
shrewd
she
was
a
vixen
when
she
went
to
school
and
though
she
be
but
little
she
is
fierce
hermia
little
again
nothing
but
low
and
little
why
will
you
suffer
her
to
flout
me
thus

come
to
her

her
part
for
if

oer
their
brows
deathcounterfeiting
sleep
with
leaden
legs
and
batty
wings
doth
creep
then
crush
this
herb
into
lysanders
eye
whose
liquor
hath
this
virtuous
property
to
take
from
thence
all
error
with
his
might
and
make
his
eyeballs
roll
with
wonted
sight
when
they
next
wake
all
this
derision
shall
seem
a
dream
and
fruitless
vision
and
back
to
athens
shall
the
lovers
wend
with
league
whose
date
till
death
shall
never
end
whiles
i
in
this
affair
do
thee
employ
ill
to
my
queen
and
beg
her
indian
boy
and
then
i
will
her
charmed
eye
release
from
monsters
view
and
all
things
shall
be
peace
puck
my
fairy
lord
this
must
be
done
with
haste
for
nights
swift
dragons
cut
the
clouds
full
fast
and
yonder
shines
auroras
harbinger
at
whose
approach
ghosts
wandring
here
and
there
troop
home
to
churchyards
damned
spirits
all
that
in
crossways
and
floods
have
burial
already
to
their
wormy
beds
are
gone
for
fear
lest
day
should
look
their
shames
upon
they
wilfully
themselves
exild
from
light
and
must
for
aye
consort
with
blackbrowd
night
oberon
but
we
are
spirits
of
another
sort
i
with
the
mornings
love
have
oft
made
sport
and
like
a
forester
the
groves
may
tread
even
till
the
eastern
gate
all
fiery
red
opening
on
neptune
with
fair
blessed
beams
turns
into
yellow
gold
his
salt
green
streams
but
notwithstanding
haste
make
no
delay
we
may
effect
this
business
yet
ere
day

sweet
favours
for
this
hateful
fool
i
did
upbraid
her
and
fall
out
with
her
for
she
his
hairy
temples
then
had
rounded
with
coronet
of
fresh
and
fragrant
flowers
and
that
same
dew
which
sometime
on
the
buds
was
wont
to
swell
like
round
and
orient
pearls
stood
now
within
the
pretty
flowerets

like
tears
that
did
their
own
disgrace
bewail
when
i
had
at
my
pleasure
taunted
her
and
she
in
mild
terms
beggd
my
patience
i
then
did
ask
of
her
her
changeling
child
which
straight
she
gave
me
and
her
fairy
sent
to
bear
him
to
my
bower
in
fairy
land
and
now
i
have
the
boy
i
will
undo
this
hateful
imperfection
of
her
eyes

this
transformed
scalp
from
off

of
this
athenian
swain

musical
confusion
of

and
echo
in
conjunction
hippolyta
i
was
with
hercules
and
cadmus
once
when
in
a
wood
of
crete
they
bayd
the
bear
with
hounds
of
sparta
never
did
i
hear
such
gallant
chiding
for
besides
the
groves
the
skies
the
fountains
every
region
near
seemd
all
one
mutual
cry
i
never
heard
so
musical
a
discord
such
sweet
thunder
theseus
my
hounds
are
bred
out
of
the
spartan
kind
so
flewd
so
sanded
and
their
heads
are
hung
with
ears
that
sweep
away
the
morning
dew
crookkneed
and
dewlappd
like
thessalian
bulls
slow
in
pursuit
but
matchd
in
mouth
like
bells
each
under
each
a
cry
more
tuneable
was
never
hollad
to
nor
cheerd
with
horn
in
crete
in
sparta

in
thessaly
judge
when
you

is
my
daughter
here
asleep
and
this
lysander
this
demetrius

helena

wonder
of
their
being
here
together
theseus
no
doubt
they
rose
up
early
to
observe
the
rite
of
may
and
hearing
our
intent
came
here
in
grace
of
our
solemnity
but
speak
egeus

not
this
the
day
that
hermia
should
give
answer
of
her
choice
egeus

is
my
lord

lysander
pardon
my
lord
theseus
i
pray
you
all
stand
up
i
know
you
two
are
rival
enemies
how
comes
this
gentle
concord
in
the
world
that
hatred
is
so
far
from
jealousy
to
sleep
by
hate
and
fear
no
enmity
lysander
my
lord
i
shall
reply
amazedly
half
sleep
half
waking
but
as
yet
i
swear
i
cannot
truly
say
how
i
came
here
but
as
i
think
for
truly
would
i
speak
and
now
i
do
bethink
me
so
it
is
i
came
with
hermia
hither
our
intent
was
to
be
gone
from
athens
where
we
might
without
the
peril
of
the
athenian
law
egeus
enough
enough
my
lord
you
have
enough
i
beg
the
law
the
law
upon
his
head
they
would
have
stoln
away
they
would
demetrius
thereby
to
have
defeated
you
and
me
you
of
your
wife
and
me
of
my
consent
of
my
consent
that
she
should
be
your
wife
demetrius
my
lord
fair
helen
told
me
of
their
stealth
of
this
their
purpose
hither
to
this
wood
and
i
in
fury
hither
followed
them
fair
helena
in
fancy
following
me
but
my
good
lord
i
wot
not
by
what
power
but
by
some
power
it
is
my
love
to
hermia
melted
as
the
snow
seems
to
me
now
as
the
remembrance
of
an
idle
gaud
which
in
my
childhood
i
did
dote
upon
and
all
the
faith
the
virtue
of
my
heart
the
object
and
the
pleasure
of
mine
eye
is
only
helena
to
her
my
lord
was
i
betrothd
ere
i
saw
hermia
but
like
a
sickness
did
i
loathe
this
food
but
as
in
health
come
to
my
natural
taste
now
i
do
wish
it
love
it
long
for
it
and
will
for
evermore
be
true
to
it
theseus
fair
lovers
you
are
fortunately
met
of
this
discourse

more
will

by
with

solemnity

egeus

things
seem
small
and
undistinguishable
like
faroff
mountains
turned
into
clouds
hermia
methinks
i
see
these
things
with
parted
eye
when
every
thing
seems
double
helena

methinks
and
i
have
found
demetrius
like
a
jewel
mine
own
and
not
mine
own
demetrius

hippolyta
tis
strange
my
theseus
that
these
lovers
speak
of
theseus
more
strange
than
true
i
never
may
believe
these
antique
fables
nor
these
fairy
toys
lovers
and
madmen
have
such
seething
brains
such
shaping
fantasies
that
apprehend
more
than
cool
reason
ever
comprehends
the
lunatic
the
lover
and
the
poet
are
of
imagination
all
compact
one
sees
more
devils
than
vast
hell
can
hold
that
is
the
madman
the
lover
all
as
frantic
sees
helens
beauty
in
a
brow
of
egypt
the
poets
eye
in
a
fine
frenzy
rolling
doth
glance
from
heaven
to
earth
from
earth
to
heaven
and
as
imagination
bodies
forth
the
forms
of
things
unknown
the
poets
pen
turns
them
to
shapes
and
gives
to
airy
nothing
a
local
habitation
and
a
name
such
tricks
hath
strong
imagination
that
if
it
would
but
apprehend
some
joy
it
comprehends
some
bringer
of
that
joy
or
in

night
imagining
some
fear
how
easy

the

with

of
my
kinsman
hercules
the
riot
of
the
tipsy
bacchanals
tearing
the
thracian
singer
in
their
rage

is
an
old
device
and
it
was
playd

a
conqueror
the
thrice
three
muses
mourning
for
the
death
of
learning
late
deceasd
in

that
is
some
satire
keen
and
critical
not
sorting
with
a
nuptial
ceremony
a
tedious
brief
scene
of
young
pyramus
and
his
love
thisby
very
tragical
mirth
merry
and
tragical
tedious
and
brief
that
is
hot
ice
and
wondrous
strange
snow
how
shall
we
find
the
concord
of
this
discord
philostrate
a
play
there
is
my
lord
some
ten
words
long
which
is
as
brief
as
i
have
known
a
play
but
by
ten
words
my
lord
it
is
too
long
which
makes
it
tedious
for
in
all
the
play
there
is
not
one
word
apt
one
player
fitted
and
tragical
my
noble
lord
it
is
for
pyramus
therein
doth
kill
himself
which
when
i
saw
rehearsd
i
must
confess
made
mine
eyes
water
but
more
merry
tears
the
passion
of
loud
laughter
never
shed
theseus
what
are
they
that
do
play
it
philostrate
hardhanded
men
that
work
in
athens
here
which
never
labourd
in
their
minds
till
now
and
now
have
toild
their
unbreathed
memories
with
this
same
play
against
your
nuptial
theseus
and
we
will
hear
it
philostrate
no
my
noble
lord
it
is
not
for
you
i
have
heard
it
over
and
it
is
nothing
nothing
in
the
world
unless
you
can
find
sport
in
their
intents
extremely
stretchd
and
connd
with
cruel
pain
to
do
you
service
theseus
i
will
hear
that
play
for
never
anything
can
be
amiss
when
simpleness
and
duty
tender

go
bring
them
in

merit
where
i

come
great
clerks
have
purposed
to
greet
me
with
premeditated
welcomes
where
i
have
seen
them
shiver
and
look
pale
make
periods
in
the
midst
of
sentences
throttle
their
practisd
accent
in
their
fears
and
in
conclusion
dumbly
have
broke
off
not
paying
me
a
welcome
trust
me
sweet
out
of
this
silence
yet
i
pickd
a
welcome

in

as
from

with
our
good
will
that
you
should
think
we
come
not
to
offend
but
with
good
will
to
show
our
simple
skill
that
is
the
true
beginning
of
our
end

a
good
moral
my

it
is
not
enough
to
speak
but
to
speak
true
hippolyta
indeed
he
hath
playd
on
this
prologue
like
a
child
on
a
recorder
a
sound
but
not

wonder
this
man
with
lanthorn
dog
and
bush
of
thorn
presenteth
moonshine
for
if
you
will
know
by
moonshine
did
these
lovers
think
no
scorn
to
meet
at
ninus
tomb
there
there
to
woo
this
grisly
beast
which
lion
hight
by

by

rather

lion
vile
with
bloody
mouth
did
stain
anon
comes
pyramus
sweet
youth

tall
and
finds
his
trusty
thisbys
mantle
slain
whereat
with

with
bloody
blameful
blade
he
bravely
broachd
his
boiling
bloody
breast

a
crannied
hole
or
chink
through
which
the
lovers

whisper
often
very
secretly
this

lion
you
ladies
you
whose
gentle
hearts
do
fear
the
smallest
monstrous
mouse
that
creeps
on
floor
may
now
perchance
both
quake
and
tremble
here
when
lion
rough
in
wildest
rage
doth
roar
then
know
that
i
as
snug
the
joiner
am
a
lion
fell
nor
else
no
lions
dam
for
if
i
should
as
lion
come
in
strife
into
this
place
twere
pity
on
my
life
theseus
a
very
gentle
beast
and
of
a
good
conscience
demetrius
the
very
best
at
a
beast
my
lord
that
eer
i
saw
lysander
this
lion
is
a
very
fox
for
his
valour
theseus
true
and
a
goose
for
his
discretion
demetrius
not
so
my
lord
for
his
valour
cannot
carry
his
discretion
and
the
fox
carries
the
goose
theseus
his
discretion
i
am
sure
cannot
carry
his
valour
for
the
goose
carries
not
the
fox
it
is
well
leave
it
to
his
discretion
and
let
us
listen
to
the
moon
moonshine
this
lanthorn
doth
the
horned
moon
present
demetrius
he
should
have
worn
the
horns
on
his
head
theseus
he
is
no
crescent
and
his
horns
are
invisible
within
the
circumference
moonshine
this
lanthorn
doth
the
horned
moon
present
myself
the
man
i
th
moon
do
seem
to
be
theseus
this
is
the
greatest
error
of
all
the
rest
the
man
should
be
put
into
the
lantern
how
is
it
else
the
man
i
th
moon
demetrius
he
dares
not
come
there
for
the
candle
for
you
see
it
is
already
in
snuff
hippolyta
i
am
aweary
of
this
moon
would
he
would
change
theseus
it
appears
by
his
small
light
of
discretion
that
he
is
in
the
wane
but
yet
in
courtesy
in
all
reason
we
must
stay
the
time
lysander
proceed
moon
moon
all
that
i
have
to

is
to

leonato
governor
of
messina
hero
his
daughter
and
beatrice
his
niece
with
a
messenger

leon
i
learn
in
this
letter
that
don
pedro
of
arragon
comes
this
night
to
messina
mess
he
is
very
near
by
this
he
was
not
three
leagues
off
when
i
left
him
leon
how
many
gentlemen
have
you
lost
in
this
action
mess
but
few
of
any
sort
and
none
of
name
leon
a
victory
is
twice
itself
when
the
achiever
brings
home
full
numbers
i
find
here
that
don
pedro
hath
bestowed
much
honour
on
a
young
florentine
called
claudio
mess
much
deservd
on
his
part
and
equally
remembred
by
don
pedro
he
hath
borne
himself
beyond
the
promise
of
his
age
doing
in
the
figure
of
a
lamb
the
feats
of
a
lion
he
hath
indeed
better
bettred
expectation
than
you
must
expect
of
me
to
tell
you
how
leon
he
hath
an
uncle
here
in
messina
will
be
very
much
glad
of
it
mess
i
have
already
delivered
him
letters
and
there
appears
much
joy
in
him
even
so
much
that
joy
could
not
show
itself
modest
enough
without
a
badge
of
bitterness
leon
did
he
break
out
into
tears
mess
in
great
measure
leon
a
kind
overflow
of
kindness
there
are
no
faces
truer
than
those
that
are
so
washd
how
much
better
is
it
to
weep
at
joy
than
to
joy
at
weeping
beat
i
pray
you
is
signior
mountanto
returnd
from
the
wars
or
no
mess
i
know
none
of

mistake
my
niece
there
is
a
kind
of
merry
war
betwixt

never
meet
but
theres
a
skirmish
of
wit
between
them
beat
alas
he
gets
nothing
by
that
in
our
last
conflict
four
of
his
five
wits
went
halting
off
and
now
is
the
whole
man
governd
with
one
so
that
if
he
have
wit
enough
to
keep
himself
warm
let
him
bear
it
for
a
difference
between
himself
and
his
horse
for
it
is
all
the
wealth
that
he
hath
left
to
be
known
a
reasonable
creature
who
is
his
companion
now
he
hath
every
month
a
new
sworn
brother
mess
ist
possible
beat
very
easily
possible
he
wears
his
faith
but
as
the
fashion
of
his
hat
it
ever
changes
with
the
next
block
mess
i
see
lady
the
gentleman
is
not
in
your
books
beat
no
an
he
were
i
would
burn
my
study
but
i
pray
you
who
is
his
companion
is
there
no
young
squarer
now
that
will
make
a
voyage
with
him
to
the
devil
mess
he
is
most
in
the
company
of
the
right
noble
claudio
beat
o
lord
he
will
hang
upon
him
like
a
disease
he
is
sooner
caught
than
the
pestilence
and
the
taker
runs
presently
mad
god
help
the
noble
claudio
if
he
have
caught
the
benedick
it
will
cost
him
a
thousand
pound
ere
a
be
cured
mess
i
will
hold
friends
with
you
lady
beat
do
good
friend
leon
you
will
never
run
mad
niece
beat
no
not
till
a
hot
january
mess
don
pedro
is
approachd

enter
don
pedro
claudio
benedick
balthasar
and
john
the
bastard

pedro
good
signior
leonato
are
you
come
to
meet
your
trouble
the
fashion
of
the
world
is
to
avoid
cost
and
you
encounter
it
leon
never
came
trouble
to
my
house
in
the
likeness
of
your
grace
for
trouble
being
gone
comfort
should
remain
but
when
you
depart
from
me
sorrow
abides
and
happiness
takes
his
leave
pedro
you
embrace
your
charge
too
willingly
i
think
this
is
your
daughter
leon
her
mother
hath
many
times
told
me
so
bene
were
you
in
doubt
sir
that
you
askd
her
leon
signior
benedick
no
for
then
were
you
a
child
pedro
you
have
it
full
benedick
we
may
guess
by
this
what
you
are
being
a
man
truly
the
lady
fathers
herself
be
happy
lady
for
you
are
like
an
honourable
father
bene
if
signior
leonato
be
her
father
she
would
not
have
his
head
on
her
shoulders
for
all
messina
as
like
him
as
she
is
beat
i
wonder
that
you
will
still
be
talking
signior
benedick
nobody
marks
you
bene
what
my
dear
lady
disdain
are
you
yet
living
beat
is
it
possible
disdain
should
die
while
she
hath
such
meet
food
to
feed
it
as
signior
benedick
courtesy
itself
must
convert
to
disdain
if
you
come
in
her
presence
bene
then
is
courtesy
a
turncoat
but
it
is
certain
i
am
loved
of
all
ladies
only
you
excepted
and
i
would
i
could
find
in
my
heart
that
i
had
not
a
hard
heart
for
truly
i
love
none
beat
a
dear
happiness
to
women
they
would
else
have
been
troubled
with
a
pernicious
suitor
i
thank
god
and
my
cold
blood
i
am
of
your
humour
for
that
i
had
rather
hear
my
dog
bark
at
a
crow
than
a
man
swear
he
loves
me
bene
god
keep
your
ladyship
still
in
that
mind
so
some
gentleman
or
other
shall
scape
a
predestinate
scratchd
face
beat
scratching
could
not
make
it
worse
an
twere
such
a
face
as
yours
were
bene
well
you
are
a
rare
parrotteacher
beat
a
bird
of
my
tongue
is
better
than
a
beast
of
yours
bene
i
would
my
horse
had
the
speed
of
your
tongue
and
so
good
a
continuer
but
keep
your
way
a
gods
name
i
have
done
beat
you
always
end
with
a
jades
trick
i
know
you
of
old
pedro
that
is
the
sum
of
all
leonato
signior
claudio
and
signior
benedick
my
dear
friend
leonato
hath
invited
you
all

tell
him
we
shall
stay
here
at
the
least
a
month
and
he
heartly
prays
some
occasion
may
detain
us
longer
i
dare
swear
he
is
no
hypocrite
but
prays
from
his
heart
leon

you
swear
my
lord
you
shall
not
be
forsworn
to
don
john
let
me
bid
you

what
secret
hath
held
you
here
that
you
followed
not
to
leonatos
bene
i
would
your
grace
would
constrain
me
to
tell
pedro
i
charge

short
his

it
uttred
bene
like
the
old
tale
my

nor
twas
not
so
but
indeed
god
forbid
it
should
be
so
claud
if
my
passion
change
not
shortly
god
forbid
it
should
be
otherwise
pedro
amen
if

worthy
i
know
bene
that
i
neither
feel
how
she
should
be
loved

how
she
should
be
worthy
is
the
opinion
that
fire
cannot
melt
out
of
me
i
will
die
in
it
at
the
stake
pedro
thou
wast
ever
an
obstinate
heretic
in
the
despite
of
beauty
claud
and
never
could
maintain
his
part

in
the
force
of
his
will
bene
that
a
woman
conceived
me
i
thank
her
that
she
brought
me
up
i
likewise
give
her
most
humble
thanks
but
that
i
will
have
a
rechate
winded
in
my
forehead
or
hang
my
bugle
in
an
invisible
baldrick
all
women
shall
pardon
me
because
i
will
not
do
them
the
wrong
to
mistrust
any
i
will
do
myself
the
right
to
trust
none
and
the
fine
is
for
the
which
i
may
go
the
finer
i
will
live
a
bachelor
pedro
i
shall
see
thee
ere
i
die
look
pale
with
love
bene
with
anger
with
sickness
or
with
hunger
my
lord
not
with
love
prove
that
ever
i
lose
more
blood
with
love
than
i
will
get
again
with
drinking
pick
out
mine
eyes
with
a
balladmakers
pen
and
hang
me
up
at
the
door
of
a
brothel
house
for
the
sign
of
blind
cupid
pedro
well
if
ever
thou
dost
fall
from
this
faith
thou
wilt
prove
a
notable
argument
bene
if
i
do
hang
me
in
a
bottle
like
a
cat
and
shoot
at
me
and
he
that
hits
me
let
him

calld
adam
pedro
well
as
time
shall

savage
bull
may
but
if

the
sensible
benedick

it
pluck
off
the
bulls

set
them
in
my
forehead
and
let

be
vilely
painted

such
great
letters
as
they
write
here
is
good
horse
to
hire
let
them
signify
under
my
sign
here
you
may
see

the
body
of
your
discourse

sometime
guarded
with
fragments
and
the
guards

but
slightly
basted
on
neither
ere
you
flout
old
ends
any
further
examine
your
conscience
and
so
i
leave
you


















exit
claud
my
liege

and
thou
shalt

learn
any
hard
lesson

do
thee
good
claud

his
only
heir

thou
affect
her
claudio
claudo
my
lord
when
you
went
onward
on
this
ended
action
i
lookd
upon
her
with
a
soldiers
eye
that
likd
but
had
a
rougher
task
in
hand
than
to
drive
liking
to
the
name
of
love
but
now
i
am
returnd
and
that
warthoughts
have
left
their
places
vacant
in
their
rooms
come
thronging
soft
and
delicate
desires
all
prompting
me
how
fair
young
hero
is
saying
i
likd
her
ere
i
went
to
wars
pedro
thou
wilt
be
like
a
lover
presently
and
tire
the
hearer
with
a
book
of
words
if
thou
dost
love
fair
hero
cherish
it
and
i
will
break
with
her
and
with
her
father
and
thou
shalt
have
her
wast
not
to
this
end
that
thou
beganst
to
twist
so
fine
a
story
claud
how
sweetly
you
do
minister
to
love
that
know
loves
grief
by
his
complexion
but
lest
my
liking
might
too
sudden
seem
i
would
have
salvd
it
with
a
longer
treatise
pedro
what
need
the
bridge
much
broader
than
the
flood
the
fairest
grant
is
the
necessity
look
what
will
serve
is
fit
tis
once
thou
lovest
and
i
will
fit
thee
with
the
remedy
i
know
we
shall
have
revelling
tonight
i
will
assume
thy
part
in
some
disguise
and
tell
fair
hero
i
am
claudio
and
in
her
bosom
ill
unclasp
my
heart
and
take
her
hearing
prisoner
with
the
force
and
strong
encounter
of
my
amorous
tale
then
after
to
her
father
will
i
break
and
the
conclusion
is
she
shall
be
thine
in
practice

us
put

another

house

enter
sir
john
the
bastard
and
conrade
his
companion

con
what
the
goodyear
my
lord
why
are
you
thus
out
of
measure
sad
john
there
is
no
measure
in
the
occasion
that
breeds
therefore
the
sadness
is
without
limit
con
you
should
hear
reason
john
and
when
i
have
heard
it
what
blessings
brings
it
con
if
not
a
present
remedy
at
least
a
patient
sufferance
john
i
wonder
that
thou
being
as
thou
sayst
thou
art
born
under
saturn
goest
about
to
apply
a
moral
medicine
to
a
mortifying
mischief
i
cannot
hide
what
i
am
i
must
be
sad
when
i
have
cause
and
smile
at
no
mans
jests
eat
when
i
have
stomach
and
wait
for
no
mans
leisure
sleep
when
i
am
drowsy
and
tend
on
no
mans
business
laugh
when
i
am
merry
and
claw
no
man
in
his
humour
con
yea
but
you
must
not
make
the
full
show
of
this
till
you
may
do
it
without
controlment
you
have
of
late
stood
out
against
your
brother
and
he
hath
taen
you
newly
into
his
grace
where
it
is
impossible
you
should
take
true
root
but
by
the
fair
weather
that
you
make
yourself
it
is
needful
that
you
frame
the
season
for
your
own
harvest
john
i
had
rather
be
a
canker
in
a
hedge
than
a
rose
in
his
grace
and
it
better
fits
my
blood
to
be
disdaind
of
all
than
to
fashion
a
carriage
to
rob
love
from
any
in
this
though
i
cannot
be
said
to
be
a
flattering
honest
man
it
must
not
be
denied
but
i
am
a
plaindealing
villain
i
am
trusted
with
a
muzzle
and
enfranchisd
with
a
clog
therefore
i
have
decreed
not
to
sing
in
my
cage
if
i
had
my
mouth
i
would
bite
if
i
had
my
liberty
i
would
do
my
liking
in
the
meantime
let
me
be
that
i
am
and
seek
not
to
alter
me
con
can
you
make
no
use
of
your
discontent
john

make
all
use
of
it

made
just
in
the
midway
between
him
and
benedick
the
one
is
too
like

nothing
and
the
other
too
like
my
ladys
eldest

too
curst

you
may
light

that
hath
no
beard
beat
what
should
i
do
with
him
dress
him
in
my
apparel
and
make
him
my
waiting
gentlewoman
he
that
hath
a
beard
is
more
than
a
youth
and
he
that
hath
no
beard
is
less
than
a
man
and
he
that
is
more
than
a
youth
is
not
for
me
and
he
that
is
less
than
a
man
i
am
not
for
him

because

but
so
i
am
apt
to
do
myself
wrong
i
am
not
so
reputed
it
is
the
base
though
bitter
disposition
of
beatrice
that
puts
the
world
into
her
person
and
so
gives
me
out

a
lodge
in

warren

told
him
and
i
think
i
told
him
true
that
your
grace
had
got
the
good
will
of
this
young
lady
and
i
offred
him
my
company
to
a
willow
tree
either
to
make
him
a
garland
as
being
forsaken
or
to
bind
him
up
a
rod
as
being
worthy
to
be
whipt
pedro
to
be
whipt
whats
his
fault
bene
the
flat
transgression
of
a
schoolboy
who
being
overjoyed
with
finding
a
birds
nest
shows
it
his
companion
and
he
steals
it
pedro
wilt
thou
make
a
trust
a
transgression
the
transgression
is
in
the
stealer
bene
yet
it
had
not
been
amiss
the
rod
had
been
made
and
the
garland
too
for
the
garland
he
might
have
worn
himself
and
the
rod
he
might
have
bestowed
on
you
who
as
i
take
it
have
stoln
his
birds
nest
pedro

will

she
told
me
not

had
been
myself

jester
that
i
was
duller
than
a
great
thaw
huddling
jest
upon
jest
with
such
impossible
conveyance
upon
me
that
i
stood
like
a
man
at
a
mark
with
a
whole
army
shooting
at
me
she
speaks
poniards
and
every
word
stabs
if
her
breath
were
as
terrible
as
her
terminations
there
were
no
living
near
her
she
would
infect
to
the
north
star
i
would
not
marry
her
though
she
were
endowed
with
all
that
adam
had
left
him
before

cleft
his
club

make
the
fire
too
come
talk
not
of

infernal
ate

for
certainly
while
she
is
here
a
man
may
live
as
quiet
in
hell
as
in
a
sanctuary
and
people
sin
upon
purpose
because

would
go

be
medcinable
to
me
i
am
sick
in
displeasure

evenly
with
mine
how
canst

this
marriage
bora

so
covertly
that
no

me
briefly
how
bora
i
think
i
told
your
lordship
a
year
since
how
much
i
am
in
the
favour
of
margaret
the
waiting
gentlewoman
to
hero
john
i
remember
bora
i
can
at
any
unseasonable
instant
of
the
night
appoint
her
to
look
out
at
her
ladys
chamber
window
john
what
life
is
in
that
to
be
the
death
of
this
marriage
bora
the
poison
of
that
lies
in
you
to
temper
go
you
to
the
prince
your
brother
spare
not
to
tell
him
that
he
hath
wronged
his
honour
in
marrying
the
renowned
claudio
whose
estimation
do
you
mightily
hold
up
to
a
contaminated
stale
such
a
one
as
hero
john
what
proof
shall
i
make
of
that
bora
proof
enough
to
misuse
the
prince
to
vex
claudio
to
undo
hero
and
kill
leonato
look
you
for
any
other
issue
john
only
to
despite
them
i
will
endeavour
anything
bora
go
then
find
me
a
meet
hour
to
draw
don
pedro
and
the
count
claudio
alone
tell
them
that
you
know
that
hero
loves
me
intend
a
kind
of
zeal
both
to
the
prince
and
claudio
asin
love
of
your
brothers

match
and
his
friends
reputation
who
is
thus
like
to
be
cozend
with
the
semblance
of
a
maidthat
you
have
discoverd
thus
they
will
scarcely
believe
this
without
trial
offer
them
instances
which
shall
bear
no
less
likelihood
than
to
see
me
at
her
chamber
window
hear
me
call
margaret
hero
hear
margaret
term
me
claudio
and
bring
them
to
see
this
the
very
night
before
the
intended
wedding
for
in
the
meantime
i
will
so
fashion
the
matter
that
hero
shall
be
absent
and
there
shall
appear
such
seeming
truth
of
heros
disloyalty
that
jealousy
shall
be
calld
assurance
and
all
the
preparation
overthrown
john
grow
this
to
what
adverse
issue
it
can
i

thy
fee
is
a
thousand
ducats

orchard

enter
benedick
alone

bene
boy

enter
boy

boy
signior
bene
in
my
chamber
window
lies
a
book
bring
it
hither
to
me
in
the
orchard
boy
i
am
here
already
sir
bene
i
know
that
but
i
would
have
thee
hence
and
here
again
exit
boy
i
do
much
wonder
that
one
man
seeing
how
much
another
man
is
a
fool
when
he
dedicates
his
behaviours
to
love
will
after
he
hath
laughd
at
such
shallow
follies
in
others
become
the
argument
of
his
own
scorn
by
falling
in
love
and
such
a
man
is
claudio
i
have
known
when
there
was
no
music
with
him
but
the
drum
and
the
fife
and
now
had
he
rather
hear
the
tabor
and
the
pipe
i
have
known
when
he
would
have
walkd
ten
mile
afoot
to
see
a
good
armour
and
now
will
he
lie
ten
nights
awake
carving
the
fashion
of
a
new
doublet
he
was
wont
to
speak
plain
and
to
the
purpose
like
an
honest
man
and
a
soldier
and
now
is
he
turnd
orthography
his
words
are
a
very
fantastical
banquet
just
so
many
strange
dishes
may
i
be
so
converted
and
see
with
these
eyes
i
cannot
tell
i
think
not
i
will
not
be
sworn
but
love
may
transform
me
to
an
oyster
but
ill
take
my
oath
on
it
till
he
have
made
an
oyster
of
me
he
shall
never
make
me
such
a
fool
one
woman
is
fair
yet
i
am
well
another
is
wise
yet
i
am
well
another
virtuous
yet
i
am
well
but
till
all
graces
be
in
one
woman
one
woman
shall
not
come
in
my
grace
rich
she
shall
be
thats
certain
wise
or

none
virtuous
or

never
cheapen
her

or
ill
never

on
her
mild
or
come
not
near

or
not

for
an
angel
of

pedro
do
so
farewell
exit
balthasar
with

come
hither
leonato
what
was
it
you
told
me
of
today
that
your
niece
beatrice
was
in
love
with
signior
benedick
claud
o
ayaside
to
pedro
stalk
on
stalk
on
the
fowl
sits
i
did
never
think
that
lady
would
have
loved
any
man
leon
no
nor
i
neither
but
most
wonderful
that
she
should
so
dote
on
signior
benedick
whom
she
hath
in
all
outward
behaviours
seemd
ever
to
abhor
bene
aside
ist
possible
sits
the
wind
in
that
corner
leon
by
my
troth
my
lord
i
cannot
tell
what
to
think
of
it
but
that
she
loves
him
with
an
enraged
affection
it
is
past
the
infinite
of
thought
pedro
may
be
she
doth
but
counterfeit
claud
faith
like
enough
leon
o
god
counterfeit
there
was
never
counterfeit
of
passion
came
so
near
the
life
of
passion
as
she
discovers
it
pedro
why
what
effects
of
passion
shows
she
claud
aside
bait
the
hook
well
this
fish
will
bite
leon
what
effects
my
lord
she
will
sit
youyou
heard
my
daughter
tell
you
how
claud
she
did
indeed
pedro
how
how
i
pray
you
you
amaze
me
i
would
have
thought
her
spirit
had
been
invincible
against
all
assaults
of
affection
leon
i
would
have
sworn
it
had
my
lordespecially
against
benedick
bene
aside
i
should
think
this
a
gull
but
that
the
whitebearded
fellow
speaks
it
knavery
cannot
sure
hide
himself
in
such
reverence
claud
aside
he
hath
taen
th
infection
hold
it
up
pedro
hath
she
made
her
affection
known
to
benedick
leon
no
and
swears
she
never
will
thats
her
torment
claud
tis
true
indeed
so
your
daughter
says
shall
i
says
she
that
have
so
oft
encountred
him
with
scorn
write
to
him
that
i
love
him
leon
this
says
she
now
when
she
is
beginning
to
write
to
him
for
shell
be
up
twenty
times
a
night
and
there
will
she
sit
in
her
smock
till
she
have
writ
a
sheet
of
paper
my
daughter
tells
us
all
claud
now
you
talk
of
a
sheet
of
paper
i
remember
a
pretty
jest
your
daughter
told
us
of
leon
o
when
she
had
writ
it
and
was
reading
it
over
she
found
benedick
and
beatrice
between
the
sheet
claud
that
leon
o
she
tore
the
letter
into
a
thousand
halfpence
raild
at
herself
that
she
should
be
so
immodest
to
write
to
one
that
she
knew
would
flout
her
i
measure
him
says
she
by
my
own
spirit
for
i
should
flout
him
if
he
writ
to
me
yea
though
i
love
him
i
should
claud
then
down
upon
her
knees
she
falls
weeps
sobs
beats
her
heart
tears
her
hair
prays
curseso
sweet
benedick
god
give
me
patience
leon
she
doth
indeed
my
daughter
says
so
and
the
ecstasy
hath
so
much
overborne
her
that
my
daughter
is
sometime
afeard
she
will
do
a
desperate
outrage
to
herself
it
is
very
true
pedro
it
were
good
that
benedick
knew
of
it
by
some
other
if
she
will
not
discover
it
claud
to
what
end
he
would
make
but
a
sport
of
it
and
torment
the
poor
lady
worse
pedro
an
he
should
it
were
an
alms
to
hang
him
shes
an
excellent
sweet
lady
and
out
of
all
suspicion
she
is
virtuous
claud
and
she
is
exceeding
wise
pedro
in
everything
but
in
loving
benedick
leon
o
my
lord
wisdom
and
blood
combating
in
so
tender
a
body
we
have
ten
proofs
to
one
that
blood
hath
the
victory
i
am
sorry
for
her
as
i
have
just
cause
being
her
uncle
and
her
guardian
pedro
i
would
she
had
bestowed
this
dotage
on
me
i
would
have
daffd
all
other
respects
and
made
her
half
myself
i
pray
you
tell
benedick
of
it
and
hear
what
a
will
say
leon
were
it
good
think
you
claud
hero
thinks
surely
she
will
die
for
she
says
she
will
die
if
he
love
her
not
and
she
will
die
ere
she
make
her
love
known
and
she
will
die
if
he
woo
her
rather
than
she
will
bate
one
breath
of
her
accustomed
crossness
pedro
she
doth
well
if
she
should
make
tender
of
her
love
tis
very
possible
hell
scorn
it
for
the
man
as
you
know
all
hath
a
contemptible
spirit
claud
he
is
a
very
proper
man
pedro
he
hath
indeed
a
good
outward
happiness
claud
before
god
and
in
my
mind
very
wise
pedro
he
doth
indeed
show
some
sparks
that
are
like
wit
claud
and
i
take
him
to
be
valiant
pedro
as
hector
i
assure
you
and
in
the
managing
of
quarrels
you
may
say
he
is
wise
for
either
he
avoids
them
with
great
discretion
or
undertakes
them
with
a
most
christianlike
fear
leon
if
he
do
fear
god
a
must
necessarily
keep
peace
if
he
break
the
peace
he
ought
to
enter
into
a
quarrel
with
fear
and
trembling
pedro
and
so
will
he
do
for
the
man
doth
fear
god
howsoever
it
seems
not
in
him
by
some
large
jests
he
will
make
well
i
am
sorry
for
your
niece
shall
we
go
seek
benedick
and
tell
him
of
her
love
claud
never
tell
him
my
lord
let
her
wear
it
out
with
good
counsel
leon
nay
thats
impossible
she
may
wear
her
heart
out
first
pedro
well
we
will
hear
further
of
it
by
your
daughter
let
it
cool
the
while
i
love
benedick
well
and
i
could
wish
he
would
modestly
examine
himself
to
see
how
much
he
is
unworthy
so
good
a
lady
leon
my
lord
will
you
walk
dinner
is
ready
they
walk
away
claud
if
he
dote
on
her
upon
this
i
will
never
trust
my
expectation
pedro
let
there
be
the
same
net
spread
for
her
and
that
must
your
daughter
and
her
gentlewomen
carry
the
sport
will
be
when
they
hold
one
an
opinion
of
anothers
dotage
and
no
such
matter
thats
the
scene
that
i
would
see
which
will
be
merely
a
dumb
show
let
us
send
her
to
call
him
in
to
dinner
exeunt
don
pedro
claudio
and
leonato

benedick
advances
from
the
arbour

bene
this
can
be
no
trick
the
conference
was
sadly
borne
they
have
the
truth
of
this
from
hero
they
seem
to
pity
the
lady
it
seems
her
affections
have
their
full
bent
love
me
why
it
must
be
requited
i
hear
how
i
am
censurd
they
say
i
will
bear
myself
proudly
if
i
perceive
the
love
come
from
her
they
say
too
that
she
will
rather
die
than
give
any
sign
of
affection
i
did
never
think
to
marry
i
must
not
seem
proud
happy
are
they
that
hear
their
detractions
and
can
put
them
to
mending
they
say
the
lady
is
fairtis
a
truth
i
can
bear
them
witness
and
virtuous
tis
so
i
cannot
reprove
it
and
wise
but
for
loving
meby
my
troth
it
is
no
addition
to
her
wit
nor
no
great
argument
of
her
folly
for
i
will
be
horribly
in
love
with
her
i
may
chance
have
some
odd
quirks
and
remnants
of
wit
broken
on
me
because
i
have
railed
so
long
against
marriage
but
doth
not
the
appetite
alters
a
man
loves
the
meat
in
his
youth
that
he
cannot
endure
in
his
age
shall
quips
and
sentences
and
these
paper
bullets
of
the
brain
awe
a
man
from
the
career
of
his
humour
no
the
world
must
be
peopled
when
i
said
i
would
die
a
bachelor
i
did
not
think
i
should
live
till
i
were
married

enter
beatrice

here
comes
beatrice
by
this
day
shes
a
fair
lady
i
do
spy
some
marks
of
love
in
her
beat
against
my
will
i
am
sent

with
the
prince
and
claudio

her
ear
and
tell
her
i
and
ursley

the
orchard
and
our
whole
discourse
is
all
of
her
say
that
thou
overheardst
us
and
bid
her
steal
into
the
pleached
bower
where
honeysuckles
ripened
by
the
sun
forbid
the
sun
to
enterlike
favourites
made
proud
by
princes
that
advance
their
pride
against
that
power
that
bred
it
there
will
she
hide
her
to
listen
our
propose
this
is
thy
office
bear
thee
well
in
it
and
leave
us
alone
marg
ill
make
her
come
i
warrant
you
presently



exit
hero
now
ursula
when
beatrice
doth
come
as
we
do
trace
this
alley
up
and
down
our
talk
must
only
be
of
benedick
when
i
do
name
him
let
it
be
thy
part
to
praise
him
more
than
ever
man
did
merit
my
talk
to
thee
must
be
how
benedick
is
sick
in
love
with
beatrice
of
this
matter
is
little
cupids
crafty
arrow
made
that
only
wounds
by
hearsay

enter
beatrice

now
begin
for
look
where
beatrice
like
a
lapwing
runs
close
by
the
ground
to
hear
our
conference

beatrice
hides
in
the
arbour

urs
the
pleasantst
angling
is
to
see
the
fish
cut
with
her
golden
oars
the
silver
stream
and
greedily
devour
the
treacherous
bait
so
angle
we
for
beatrice
who
even
now
is
couched
in
the
woodbine
coverture
fear
you
not
my
part
of
the
dialogue
hero
then
go
we
near
her
that
her
ear
lose
nothing
of
the
false
sweet
bait
that
we
lay
for
it
they
approach
the
arbour
no
truly
ursula
she
is
too
disdainful
i
know
her
spirits
are
as
coy
and
wild
as
haggards
of
the
rock
urs
but
are
you
sure
that
benedick
loves
beatrice
so
entirely
hero
so
says
the
prince
and
my
newtrothed
lord
urs
and
did
they
bid
you
tell
her
of
it
madam
hero
they
did
entreat
me
to
acquaint
her
of
it
but
i
persuaded
them
if
they
lovd
benedick
to
wish
him
wrestle
with
affection
and
never
to
let
beatrice
know
of
it
urs
why
did
you
so
doth
not
the
gentleman
deserve
as
full
as
fortunate
a
bed
as
ever
beatrice
shall
couch
upon
hero
o
god
of
love
i
know
he
doth
deserve
as
much
as
may
be
yielded
to
a
man
but
nature
never
framd
a
womans
heart
of
prouder
stuff
than
that
of
beatrice
disdain
and
scorn
ride
sparkling
in
her
eyes
misprizing
what
they
look
on
and
her
wit
values
itself
so
highly
that
to
her
all
matter
else
seems
weak
she
cannot
love
nor
take
no
shape
nor
project
of
affection
she
is
so
selfendeared
urs
sure
i
think
so
and
therefore
certainly
it
were
not
good
she
knew
his
love
lest
shell
make
sport
at
it
hero
why
you
speak
truth
i
never
yet
saw
man
how
wise
how
noble
young
how
rarely
featurd
but
she
would
spell
him
backward
if
fairfacd
she
would
swear
the
gentleman
should
be
her
sister
if
black
why
nature
drawing
of
an
antic
made
a
foul
blot
if
tall
a
lance
illheaded
if
low
an
agate
very
vilely
cut
if
speaking
why
a
vane
blown
with
all
winds
if
silent
why
a
block
moved
with
none
so
turns
she
every
man
the
wrong
side
out
and
never
gives
to
truth
and
virtue
that
which
simpleness
and
merit
purchaseth
urs
sure
sure
such
carping
is
not
commendable
hero
no
not
to
be
so
odd
and
from
all
fashions
as
beatrice
is
cannot
be
commendable
but
who
dare
tell
her
so
if
i
should
speak
she
would
mock
me
into
air
o
she
would
laugh
me
out
of
myself
press
me
to
death
with
wit
therefore
let
benedick
like
coverd
fire
consume
away
in
sighs
waste
inwardly
it
were
a
better
death
than
die
with
mocks
which
is
as
bad
as
die
with
tickling
urs
yet
tell
her
of
it
hear
what
she
will
say
hero
no
rather
i
will
go
to
benedick
and
counsel
him
to
fight
against
his
passion
and
truly
ill
devise
some
honest
slanders
to
stain
my
cousin
with
one
doth
not
know
how
much
an
ill
word
may
empoison
liking
urs
o
do
not
do
your
cousin
such
a
wrong
she
cannot
be
so
much
without
true
judgment
having
so
swift
and
excellent
a
wit
as
she
is
prizd
to
have
as
to
refuse
so
rare
a
gentleman

dutchman
today
a
frenchman
tomorrow
or
in

by

much
as

note
of

most
senseless

speak
like
an
ancient
and
most
quiet

care

your
bills
be
not
stoln

took
them
for
2
watch
well
sir
dog
if
you
meet
a
thief
you
may
suspect
him
by
virtue
of
your
office
to
be
no
true
man
and

peaceable
way
for

virginity
claud
i
know
what
you

much
misgovernment

foul

pure
impiety

impious
purity

i
not
with
charitable
hand
took
up
a
beggars
issue
at
my
gates
who
smirched
thus
and
mird
with
infamy
i
might
have
said
no
part
of
it
is
mine
this
shame
derives
itself
from
unknown
loins
but
mine
and
mine
i
lovd
and
mine
i
praisd
and
mine
that
i
was
proud
onmine
so
much
that
i
myself
was
to
myself
not
mine
valuing
of
herwhy
she
o
she
is
falln
into
a
pit
of
ink
that
the
wide
sea
hath
drops
too
few
to
wash
her
clean
again
and
salt
too
little
which
may
season
give
to
her
foul
tainted
flesh
bene
sir
sir
be
patient
for
my
part
i
am
so
attird
in
wonder
i
know
not
what
to
say
beat
o
on
my
soul
my
cousin
is
belied
bene
lady
were
you
her
bedfellow
last
night
beat
no
truly
not
although
until
last
night
i
have
this
twelvemonth
been
her
bedfellow
leon
confirmd
confirmd
o
that
is
stronger
made
which
was
before
barrd
up
with
ribs
of
iron
would
the
two
princes
lie
and
claudio
lie
who
lovd
her
so
that
speaking
of
her
foulness
washd
it
with
tears
hence
from
her
let
her
die
friar
hear
me
a
little
for
i
have
only
been
silent
so
long
and
given
way
unto
this
course
of
fortune
by
noting
of
the
lady
i
have
markd
a
thousand
blushing
apparitions
to
start
into
her
face
a
thousand
innocent
shames
in
angel
whiteness
beat
away
those
blushes
and
in
her
eye
there
hath
appeard
a
fire
to
burn
the
errors
that
these
princes
hold
against
her
maiden
truth
call
me
a
fool
trust
not
my
reading
nor
my
observation
which
with
experimental
seal
doth
warrant
the
tenure
of
my
book
trust
not
my
age
my
reverence
calling
nor
divinity
if
this
sweet
lady
lie
not
guiltless
here
under
some
biting
error
leon
friar
it
cannot
be
thou
seest
that
all
the
grace
that
she
hath
left
is
that
she
will
not
add
to
her
damnation
a
sin
of
perjury
she
not
denies
it
why
seekst
thou
then
to
cover
with
excuse
that
which
appears
in
proper
nakedness
friar
lady
what
man
is
he
you
are
accusd
of
hero
they
know
that
do
accuse
me
i
know
none
if
i
know
more
of
any
man
alive
than
that
which
maiden
modesty
doth
warrant
let
all
my
sins
lack
mercy
o
my
father
prove
you
that
any
man
with
me
conversd
at
hours
unmeet
or
that
i
yesternight
maintaind
the
change
of
words
with
any
creature
refuse
me
hate
me
torture
me
to
death
friar
there
is
some
strange
misprision
in
the
princes
bene
two
of
them
have
the
very
bent
of
honour
and
if
their
wisdoms
be
misled
in
this
the
practice
of
it
lives
in
john
the
bastard
whose
spirits
toil
in
frame
of
villanies
leon
i
know
not
if
they
speak
but
truth
of
her
these
hands
shall
tear
her
if
they
wrong
her
honour
the
proudest
of
them
shall
well
hear
of
it
time
hath
not
yet
so
dried
this
blood
of
mine
nor
age
so
eat
up
my
invention
nor
fortune
made
such
havoc
of
my
means
nor
my
bad
life
reft
me
so
much
of
friends
but
they
shall
find
awakd
in
such
a
kind
both
strength
of
limb
and
policy
of
mind
ability
in
means
and
choice
of
friends
to
quit
me
of
them
throughly
friar
pause
awhile
and
let
my
counsel
sway
you
in
this
case
your
daughter
here
the
princes
left
for
dead
let
her
awhile
be
secretly
kept
in
and
publish
it
that
she
is
dead
indeed
maintain
a
mourning
ostentation
and
on
your
familys
old
monument
hang
mournful
epitaphs
and
do
all
rites
that
appertain
unto
a
burial
leon
what
shall
become
of
this
what
will
this
do
friar
marry
this
well
carried
shall
on
her
behalf
change
slander
to
remorse
that
is
some
good
but
not
for
that
dream
i
on
this
strange
course
but
on
this
travail
look
for
greater
birth
she
dying
as
it
must
be
so
maintaind
upon
the
instant
that
she
was
accusd
shall
be
lamented
pitied
and
excusd
of
every
hearer
for
it
so
falls
out
that
what
we
have
we
prize
not
to
the
worth
whiles
we
enjoy
it
but
being
lackd
and
lost
why
then
we
rack
the
value
then
we
find
the
virtue
that
possession
would
not
show
us
whiles
it
was
ours
so
will
it
fare
with
claudio
when
he
shall
hear
she
died
upon
his
words
th
idea
of
her
life
shall
sweetly
creep
into
his
study
of
imagination
and
every
lovely
organ
of
her
life
shall
come
apparelld
in
more
precious
habit
more
moving
delicate
and
full
of
life
into
the
eye
and
prospect
of
his
soul
than
when
she
livd
indeed
then
shall
he
mourn
if
ever
love
had
interest
in
his
liver
and
wish
he
had
not
so
accused
her
no
though
be
thought
his
accusation
true
let
this
be
so
and
doubt
not
but
success
will
fashion
the
event
in
better
shape
than
i
can
lay
it
down
in
likelihood
but
if
all
aim
but
this
be
levelld
false
the
supposition
of
the
ladys
death
will
quench
the
wonder
of
her
infamy
and
if
it
sort
not
well
you
may
conceal
her
as
best
befits
her
wounded
reputation
in
some
reclusive
and
religious
life
out
of
all
eyes
tongues
minds
and
injuries
bene
signior
leonato
let
the
friar
advise
you

though
you
know
my
inwardness

mine

will

act
v
scene
i
the
street
near
leonatos
house

enter
leonato
and
his
brother

antonio

ant
if
you
go
on
thus
you
will
kill
yourself
and
tis
not
wisdom
thus
to
second
grief
against
yourself
leon
i
pray
thee
cease
thy
counsel
which
falls
into
mine
ears
as
profitless
as
water
in
a
sieve
give
not
me
counsel
nor
let
no
comforter
delight
mine
ear
but
such
a
one
whose
wrongs
do
suit
with
mine
bring
me
a
father
that
so
lovd
his
child
whose
joy
of
her
is
overwhelmd
like
mine
and
bid
him
speak
to
me
of
patience
measure
his
woe
the
length
and
breadth
of
mine
and
let
it
answer
every
strain
for
strain
as
thus
for
thus
and
such
a
grief
for
such
in
every
lineament
branch
shape
and
form
if
such
a
one
will
smile
and
stroke
his
beard
bid
sorrow
wag
cry
hem
when
he
should
groan
patch
grief
with
proverbs
make
misfortune
drunk
with
candlewastersbring
him
yet
to
me
and
i
of
him
will
gather
patience
but
there
is
no
such
man
for
brother
men
can
counsel
and
speak
comfort
to
that
grief
which
they
themselves
not
feel
but
tasting
it
their
counsel
turns
to
passion
which
before
would
give
preceptial
medicine
to
rage
fetter
strong
madness
in
a
silken
thread
charm
ache
with
air
and
agony
with
words
no
no
tis
all
mens
office
to
speak
patience
to
those
that
wring
under
the
load
of
sorrow
but
no
mans
virtue
nor
sufficiency
to
be
so
moral
when
he
shall
endure
the
like
himself
therefore
give
me
no
counsel
my
griefs
cry
louder
than
advertisement
ant
therein
do
men
from
children
nothing
differ
leon
i
pray
thee
peace
i
will
be
flesh
and
blood
for
there
was
never
yet
philosopher
that
could
endure
the
toothache
patiently
however
they
have
writ
the
style
of
gods
and
made
a
push
at
chance
and
sufferance
ant
yet
bend
not
all
the
harm
upon
yourself
make
those
that
do
offend

act
i
scene
i
venice
a
street

enter
roderigo
and
iago

roderigo
tush
never
tell
me
i
take
it
much
unkindly
that
thou
iago
who
hast
had
my
purse
as
if
the
strings
were
thine
shouldst
know
of
this
iago
sblood
but
you
will
not
hear
me
if
ever
i
did
dream
of
such
a
matter
abhor
me
roderigo
thou
toldst
me
thou
didst
hold
him
in
thy
hate
iago
despise
me
if
i
do
not
three
great
ones
of
the
city
in
personal
suit
to
make
me
his
lieutenant
offcappd
to
him
and
by
the
faith
of
man
i
know
my
price
i
am
worth
no
worse
a
place
but
he
as
loving
his
own
pride
and
purposes
evades
them
with
a
bumbast
circumstance
horribly
stuffd
with
epithets
of
war
and
in
conclusion
nonsuits
my
mediators
for
certes
says
he
i
have
already
chose
my
officer
and
what
was
he
forsooth
a
great
arithmetician
one
michael
cassio
a
florentine
a
fellow
almost
damnd
in
a
fair
wife
that
never
set
a
squadron
in
the
field
nor
the
division
of
a
battle
knows
more
than
a
spinster
unless
the
bookish
theoric
wherein
the
toged
consuls
can
propose
as
masterly
as
he
mere
prattle
without
practice
is
all
his
soldiership
but
he
sir
had
the
election
and
i
of
whom
his
eyes
had
seen
the
proof
at
rhodes
at
cyprus
and
on
other
grounds
christian
and
heathen
must
be
beleed
and
calmd
by
debitor
and
creditor
this
countercaster
he
in
good
time
must
his
lieutenant
be
and
i
god
bless
the
mark
his
moorships
ancient
roderigo
by
heaven
i
rather
would
have
been
his
hangman
iago
why
theres
no
remedy
tis
the
curse
of
service
preferment
goes
by
letter
and
affection
and
not
by
old
gradation
where
each
second
stood
heir
to
the
first
now
sir
be
judge
yourself
whether
i
in
any
just
term
am
affined
to
love
the
moor
roderigo










i
would
not
follow
him
then
iago
o
sir
content
you
i
follow
him
to
serve
my
turn
upon
him
we
cannot
all
be
masters
nor
all
masters
cannot
be
truly
followd
you
shall
mark
many
a
duteous
and
kneecrooking
knave
that
doting
on
his
own
obsequious
bondage
wears
out
his
time
much
like
his
masters
ass
for
nought
but
provender
and
when
hes
old
cashierd
whip
me
such
honest
knaves
others
there
are
who
trimmd
in
forms
and
visages
of
duty
keep
yet
their
hearts
attending
on
themselves
and
throwing
but
shows
of
service
on
their
lords
do
well
thrive
by
them
and
when
they
have
lined
their
coats
do
themselves
homage
these
fellows
have
some
soul
and
such
a
one
do
i
profess
myself
for
sir
it
is
as
sure
as
you
are
roderigo
were
i
the
moor
i
would
not
be
iago
in
following
him
i
follow
but
myself
heaven
is
my
judge
not
i
for
love
and
duty
but
seeming
so
for
my
peculiar
end
for
when
my
outward
action
doth
demonstrate
the
native
act
and
figure
of
my
heart
in
complement
extern
tis
not
long
after
but
i
will
wear
my
heart
upon
my
sleeve
for
daws
to
peck
at
i

roderigo
sir
i
will
answer
anything
but
i
beseech
you
ift
be
your
pleasure
and
most
wise
consent
as
partly
i
find
it
is
that
your
fair
daughter
at
this
oddeven
and
dull
watch
o
the
night
transported
with
no
worse
nor
better
guard
but
with
a
knave
of
common
hire
a
gondolier
to
the
gross
clasps
of
a
lascivious
moor
if
this
be
known
to
you
and
your
allowance
we
then
have
done
you
bold
and
saucy
wrongs
but
if
you
know
not
this
my
manners
tell
me
we
have
your
wrong
rebuke
do
not
believe
that
from
the
sense
of
all
civility
i
thus
would
play
and
trifle
with
your
reverence
your
daughter
if
you
have
not
given
her
leave
i
say
again
hath
made
a
gross
revolt
tying
her
duty
beauty
wit
and
fortunes
in
an
extravagant
and
wheeling
stranger
of
here
and
everywhere
straight
satisfy
yourself
if
she
be
in
her
chamber
or
your
house
let
loose
on
me
the
justice
of
the
state
for
thus
deluding
you
brabantio














strike
on
the
tinder
ho
give
me
a
taper
call
up
all
my
people
this
accident
is
not
unlike
my
dream
belief
of
it
oppresses
me
already
light
i
say
light

































exit
above
iago

















farewell
for
i
must
leave
you
it
seems
not
meet
nor
wholesome
to
my
place
to
be
produced
as
if
i
stay
i
shall
against
the
moor
for
i
do
know
the
state
however
this
may
gall
him
with
some
check
cannot
with
safety
cast
him
for
hes
embarkd
with
such
loud
reason
to
the
cyprus
wars
which
even
now
stands
in
act
that
for
their
souls
another
of
his
fathom
they
have
none
to
lead
their
business
in
which
regard
though
i
do
hate
him
as
i
do
hell
pains
yet
for
necessity
of
present
life
i
must
show
out
a
flag
and
sign
of
love
which
is
indeed
but
sign
that
you
shall
surely
find
him
lead
to
the
sagittary
the
raised
search
and
there
will
i
be
with
him
so
farewell

scene
iii
a
council
chamber
the
duke
and
senators
sitting
at
a
table
officers
attending

duke
there
is
no
composition
in
these
news
that
gives
them
credit
first
senator











indeed
they
are
disproportiond
my
letters
say
a
hundred
and
seven
galleys
duke
and
mine
a
hundred
and
forty
second
senator





















and
mine
two
hundred
but
though
they
jump
not
on
a
just
account
as
in
these
cases
where
the
aim
reports
tis
oft
with
difference
yet
do
they
all
confirm
a
turkish
fleet
and
bearing
up
to
cyprus
duke
nay
it
is
possible
enough
to
judgement
i
do
not
so
secure
me
in
the
error
but
the
main
article
i
do
approve
in
fearful
sense
sailor
within
what
ho
what

what

first

a
messenger

now
whats
the
business
sailor
the
turkish
preparation
makes
for
rhodes
so
was
i
bid
report
here
to
the
state
by
signior
angelo
duke
how
say
you
by
this
change
first
senator



















this
cannot
be
by
no
assay
of
reason
tis
a
pageant
to
keep
us
in
false
gaze
when
we
consider
the
importancy
of
cyprus
to
the
turk
and
let
ourselves
again
but
understand
that
as
it
more
concerns
the
turk
than
rhodes
so
may
he
with
more
facile
question
bear
it
for
that
it
stands
not
in
such
warlike
brace
but
altogether
lacks
the
abilities
that
rhodes
is
dressd
in
if
we
make
thought
of
this
we
must
not
think
the
turk
is
so
unskillful
to
leave
that
latest
which
concerns
him
first
neglecting
an
attempt
of
ease
and
gain
to
wake
and
wage
a
danger
profitless
duke
nay
in
all
confidence
hes
not
for
rhodes
first

here

you
thus

pardon
me
neither
my
place
nor
aught
i
heard
of

hath
raised
me
from
my
bed
nor
doth
the
general
care
take
hold
on
me
for
my
particular
grief
is
of
so
floodgate
and
oerbearing
nature
that
it
engluts
and
swallows
other
sorrows
and
it
is
still

daughter

dead
brabantio



































ay
to
me
she
is
abused
stoln
from
me
and
corrupted
by
spells
and
medicines
bought
of
mountebanks
for
nature
so
preposterously
to
err
being
not
deficient
blind
or
lame
of
sense
sans
witchcraft
could
not
duke
whoeer
he
be
that
in
this
foul
proceeding
hath
thus
beguiled
your
daughter
of
herself
and
you
of
her
the
bloody
book
of
law
you
shall
yourself
read
in
the
bitter
letter
after
your
own
sense
yea
though
our
proper
son
stood
in
your
action
brabantio













humbly
i
thank
your
grace
here
is
the
man
this
moor
whom
now
it
seems
your
special
mandate
for
the
state
affairs
hath
hither
brought
all


















we
are
very
sorry
fort
duke
to
othello
what
in
your
own
part
can
you
say
to
this
brabantio
nothing
but
this
is
so
othello
most
potent
grave
and
reverend
signiors
my
very
noble
and
approved
good
masters
that
i
have
taen
away
this
old
mans
daughter
it
is
most
true
true
i
have
married
her
the
very
head
and
front
of
my
offending
hath
this
extent
no
more
rude
am
i
in
my
speech
and
little
blest
with
the
soft
phrase
of
peace
for
since
these
arms
of
mine
had
seven
years
pith
till
now
some
nine
moons
wasted
they
have
used
their
dearest
action
in
the
tented
field
and
little
of
this
great
world
can
i
speak
more
than
pertains
to
feats
of
broil
and
battle
and
therefore
little
shall
i
grace
my
cause
in
speaking
for
myself
yet
by
your
gracious
patience
i
will
a
round
unvarnishd
tale
deliver
of
my
whole
course
of
love
what
drugs
what
charms
what
conjuration
and
what
mighty
magic
for
such
proceeding
i
am
charged
withal
i
won
his
daughter
brabantio











a
maiden
never
bold
of
spirit
so
still
and
quiet
that
her
motion
blushd
at
herself
and
she
in
spite
of
nature
of
years
of
country
credit
everything
to
fall
in
love
with
what
she
feard
to
look
on
it
is
judgement
maimd
and
most
imperfect
that
will
confess
perfection
so
could
err
against
all
rules
of
nature
and
must
be
driven
to
find
out
practices
of
cunning
hell
why
this
should
be
i
therefore
vouch
again
that
with
some
mixtures
powerful
oer
the
blood
or
with
some
dram
conjured
to
this
effect
he
wrought
upon
her
duke

















to
vouch
this
is
no
proof
without
more
certain
and
more
overt
test
than
these
thin
habits
and
poor
likelihoods
of
modern
seeming
do
prefer
against
him
first
senator
but
othello
speak
did
you
by
indirect
and
forced
courses
subdue
and
poison
this
young
maids
affections
or
came
it
by
request
and
such
fair
question
as
soul
to
soul
affordeth
othello




















i
do
beseech
you
send
for
the
lady
to
the
sagittary
and
let
her
speak
of
me
before
her
father
if
you
do
find
me
foul
in
her
report
the
trust
the
office
i
do
hold
of
you
not
only
take
away
but
let
your
sentence
even
fall
upon
my
life
duke




















fetch
desdemona
hither
othello
ancient
conduct
them
you
best
know
the
place
exeunt
iago
and
attendants
and
till
she
come
as
truly
as
to
heaven
i
do
confess
the
vices
of
my
blood
so
justly
to
your
grave
ears
ill
present
how
i
did
thrive
in
this
fair
ladys
love
and
she
in
mine
duke
say
it
othello
othello
her
father
loved
me
oft
invited
me
still
questiond
me
the
story
of
my
life
from
year
to
year
the
battles
sieges
fortunes
that
i
have
passd
i
ran
it
through
even
from
my
boyish
days
to
the
very
moment
that
he
bade
me
tell
it
wherein
i
spake
of
most
disastrous
chances
of
moving
accidents
by
flood
and
field
of
hairbreadth
scapes
i
the
imminent
deadly
breach
of
being
taken
by
the
insolent
foe
and
sold
to
slavery
of
my
redemption
thence
and
portance
in
my
travels
history
wherein
of
antres
vast
and
deserts
idle
rough
quarries
rocks
and
hills
whose
heads
touch
heaven
it
was
my
hint
to
speak
such
was
the
process
and
of
the
cannibals
that
each
other
eat
the
anthropophagi
and
men
whose
heads
do
grow
beneath
their
shoulders
this
to
hear
would
desdemona
seriously
incline
but
still
the
house
affairs
would
draw
her
thence
which
ever
as
she
could
with
haste
dispatch
sheld
come
again
and
with
a
greedy
ear
devour
up
my
discourse
which
i
observing
took
once
a
pliant
hour
and
found
good
means
to
draw
from
her
a
prayer
of
earnest
heart
that
i
would
all
my
pilgrimage
dilate
whereof
by
parcels
she
had
something
heard
but
not
intentively
i
did
consent
and
often
did
beguile
her
of
her
tears
when
i
did
speak
of
some
distressful
stroke
that
my
youth
sufferd
my
story
being
done
she
gave
me
for
my
pains
a
world
of
sighs
she
swore
in
faith
twas
strange
twas
passing
strange
twas
pitiful
twas
wondrous
pitiful
she
wishd
she
had
not
heard
it
yet
she
wishd
that
heaven
had
made
her
such
a
man
she
thankd
me
and
bade
me
if
i
had
a
friend
that
loved
her
i
should
but
teach
him
how
to
tell
my
story
and
that
would
woo
her
upon
this
hint
i
spake
she
loved
me
for
the
dangers
i
had
passd
and
i
loved
her
that
she
did
pity
them
this
only
is
the
witchcraft
i
have
used
here
comes
the
lady
let
her
witness
it

enter
desdemona
iago
and
attendants

duke
i
think
this
tale
would
win
my
daughter
too
good
brabantio
take
up
this
mangled
matter
at
the
best
men
do
their
broken
weapons
rather
use
than
their
bare
hands
brabantio














i
pray
you
hear
her
speak
if
she
confess
that
she
was
half
the
wooer
destruction
on
my
head
if
my
bad
blame
light
on
the
man
come
hither
gentle
mistress
do
you
perceive
in
all
this
noble
company
where
most
you
owe
obedience
desdemona





















my
noble
father
i
do
perceive
here
a
divided
duty
to
you
i
am
bound
for
life
and
education
my
life
and
education
both
do
learn
me
how
to
respect
you
you
are
the
lord
of
duty
i
am
hitherto
your
daughter
but
heres
my
husband
and
so
much
duty
as
my
mother
showd
to
you
preferring
you
before
her
father
so
much
i
challenge
that
i
may
profess
due
to
the
moor
my
lord
brabantio

















god
be
with
you
i
have
done
please
it
your
grace
on
to
the
state
affairs
i
had
rather
to
adopt
a
child
than
get
it
come
hither
moor
i
here
do
give
thee
that
with
all
my
heart
which
but
thou
hast
already
with
all
my
heart
i
would
keep
from
thee
for
your
sake
jewel
i
am
glad
at
soul
i
have
no
other
child
for
thy
escape
would
teach
me
tyranny
to
hang
clogs
on
them
i
have
done
my
lord
duke
let
me
speak
like
yourself
and
lay
a
sentence
which
as
a
grise
or
step
may
help
these
lovers
into
your
favor
when
remedies
are
past
the
griefs
are
ended
by
seeing
the
worst
which
late
on
hopes
depended
to
mourn
a
mischief
that
is
past
and
gone
is
the
next
way
to
draw
new
mischief
on
what
cannot
be
preserved
when
fortune
takes
patience
her
injury
a
mockery
makes
the
robbd
that
smiles
steals
something
from
the
thief
he
robs
himself
that
spends
a
bootless
grief
brabantio
so
let
the
turk
of
cyprus
us
beguile
we
lose
it
not
so
long
as
we
can
smile
he
bears
the
sentence
well
that
nothing
bears
but
the
free
comfort
which
from
thence
he
hears
but
he
bears
both
the
sentence
and
the
sorrow
that
to
pay
grief
must
of
poor
patience
borrow
these
sentences
to
sugar
or
to
gall
being
strong
on
both
sides
are
equivocal
but
words
are
words
i
never
yet
did
hear
that
the
bruised
heart
was
pierced
through
the
ear
i
humbly
beseech
you
proceed
to
the
affairs
of
state
duke
the
turk
with
a
most
mighty
preparation
makes
for
cyprus
othello
the
fortitude
of
the
place
is
best
known
to
you
and
though
we
have
there
a
substitute
of
most
allowed
sufficiency
yet
opinion
a
sovereign
mistress
of
effects
throws
a
more
safer
voice
on
you
you
must
therefore
be
content
to
slubber
the
gloss
of
your
new
fortunes
with
this
more
stubborn
and
boisterous
expedition
othello
the
tyrant
custom
most
grave
senators
hath
made
the
flinty
and
steel
couch
of
war
my
thricedriven
bed
of
down
i
do
agnize
a
natural
and
prompt
alacrity
i
find
in
hardness
and
do
undertake
these
present
wars
against
the
ottomites
most
humbly
therefore
bending
to
your
state
i
crave
fit
disposition
for
my
wife
due
reference
of
place
and
exhibition
with
such
accommodation
and
besort
as
levels
with
her
breeding

ill
not

it
so
othello
nor

most
gracious
duke
to
my
unfolding
lend
your
prosperous
ear
and

find
a
charter
in
your
voice
to

simpleness

what
would
you
desdemona
desdemona
that
i
did
love
the

my
downright
violence

valiant

my

if

the
rites
for

are
bereft

his
dear
absence
let
me
go
with
him
othello
let
her
have
your
voices
vouch

i
therefore
beg

not
to

the
palate
of
my
appetite

to

my
desdemona
must
i
leave
to
thee
i
prithee
let
thy
wife
attend
on
her
and
bring
them
after
in
the
best
advantage
come
desdemona
i
have
but
an
hour
of
love
of
worldly
matters
and
direction
to
spend
with
thee
we
must
obey
the
time
exeunt
othello
and
desdemona
roderigo
iago
iago
what
sayst
thou
noble
heart
roderigo
what
will
i
do
thinkest
thou
iago
why
go
to
bed
and
sleep
roderigo
i
will
incontinently
drown
myself
iago
if
thou
dost
i
shall
never
love
thee
after
why
thou
silly
gentleman
roderigo
it
is
silliness
to
live
when
to
live
is
torment
and
then
have
we
a
prescription
to
die
when
death
is
our
physician
iago
o
villainous
i
have
looked
upon
the
world
for
four
times
seven
years
and
since
i
could
distinguish
betwixt
a
benefit
and
an
injury
i
never
found
man
that
knew
how
to
love
himself
ere
i
would
say
i
would
drown
myself
for
the
love
of
a
guinea
hen
i
would
change
my
humanity
with
a
baboon
roderigo
what
should
i
do
i
confess
it
is
my
shame
to
be
so
fond
but
it
is
not
in
my
virtue
to
amend
it
iago
virtue
a
fig
tis
in
ourselves
that
we
are
thus
or
thus
our
bodies
are
gardens
to
the
which
our
wills
are
gardeners
so
that
if
we
will
plant
nettles
or
sow
lettuce
set
hyssop
and
weed
up
thyme
supply
it
with
one
gender
of
herbs
or
distract
it
with
many
either
to
have
it
sterile
with
idleness
or
manured
with
industry
why
the
power
and
corrigible
authority
of
this
lies
in
our
wills
if
the
balance
of
our
lives
had
not
one
scale
of
reason
to
poise
another
of
sensuality
the
blood
and
baseness
of
our
natures
would
conduct
us
to
most
preposterous
conclusions
but
we
have
reason
to
cool
our
raging
motions
our
carnal
stings
our
unbitted
lusts
whereof
i
take
this
that
you
call
love
to
be
a
sect
or
scion
roderigo
it
cannot
be
iago
it
is
merely
a
lust
of
the
blood
and
a
permission
of
the
will
come
be
a
man
drown
thyself
drown
cats
and
blind
puppies
i
have
professed
me
thy
friend
and
i
confess
me
knit
to
thy
deserving
with
cables
of
perdurable
toughness
i
could
never
better
stead
thee
than
now
put
money
in
thy
purse
follow
thou
the
wars
defeat
thy
favor
with
an
usurped
beard
i
say
put
money
in
thy
purse
it
cannot
be
that
desdemona
should
long
continue
her
love
to
the
moor
put
money
in
thy
purse
nor
he
his
to
her
it
was
a
violent
commencement
and
thou
shalt
see
an
answerable
sequestration
put
but
money
in
thy
purse
these
moors
are
changeable
in
their
wills
fill
thy
purse
with
money
the
food
that
to
him
now
is
as
luscious
as
locusts
shall
be
to
him
shortly
as
acerb
as
the
coloquintida
she
must
change
for
youth
when
she
is
sated
with
his
body
she
will
find
the
error
of
her
choice
she
must
have
change
she
must
therefore
put
money
in
thy
purse
if
thou
wilt
needs
damn
thyself
do
it
a
more
delicate
way
than
drowning
make
all
the
money
thou
canst
if
sanctimony
and
a
frail
vow
betwixt
an
erring
barbarian
and
a
supersubtle
venetian
be
not
too
hard
for
my
wits
and
all
the
tribe
of
hell
thou
shalt
enjoy
her
therefore
make
money
a
pox
of
drowning
thyself
it
is
clean
out
of
the
way
seek
thou
rather
to
be
hanged
in
compassing
thy
joy
than
to
be
drowned
and
go
without
her
roderigo
wilt
thou
be
fast
to
my
hopes
if
i
depend
on
the
issue
iago
thou
art
sure
of
me
go
make
money
i
have
told
thee
often
and
i
retell
thee
again
and
again
i
hate
the
moor
my
cause
is
hearted
thine
hath
no
less
reason
let
us
be
conjunctive
in
our
revenge
against
him
if
thou
canst
cuckold
him
thou
dost
thyself
a
pleasure
me
a
sport
there
are
many
events
in
the
womb
of
time
which
will
be
delivered
traverse
go
provide
thy
money
we
will
have
more
of
this
tomorrow
adieu
roderigo
where
shall
we
meet
i
the
morning
iago
at
my
lodging
roderigo
ill
be
with
thee
betimes
iago
go
to
farewell
do
you
hear
roderigo
roderigo
what
say
you
iago
no
more
of
drowning
do
you
hear
roderigo
i
am
changed
ill
go
sell
all
my
land












exit
iago
thus
do
i
ever
make
my
fool
my
purse
for
i
mine
own
gaind
knowledge
should
profane
if
i
would
time
expend
with
such
a
snipe
but
for
my
sport
and
profit
i
hate
the
moor
and
it
is
thought
abroad
that
twixt
my
sheets
he
has
done
my
office
i
know
not
ift
be
true
but
i
for
mere
suspicion
in
that
kind
will
do
as
if
for
surety
he
holds
me
well
the
better
shall
my
purpose
work
on
him
cassios
a
proper
man
let
me
see
now
to
get
his
place
and
to
plume
up
my
will
in
double
knavery
how
how
lets
see
after
some
time
to
abuse
othellos
ear
that
he
is
too
familiar
with
his
wife
he
hath
a
person
and
a
smooth
dispose
to
be
suspected
framed
to
make
women
false
the
moor
is
of
a
free
and
open
nature
that
thinks
men
honest
that
but
seem
to
be
so
and
will
as
tenderly
be
led
by
the
nose
as
asses
are
i
havet
it
is
engenderd
hell
and
night
must
bring
this
monstrous
birth
to
the

to
pelt

the
windshaked
surge

to
cast
water
on
the
burning
bear
and

never

what
wouldst
thou
write
of
me
if
thou
shouldst
praise
me
iago
o
gentle
lady
do
not
put
me
tot
for
i
am
nothing
if
not
critical
desdemona
come
on
assay
theres
one
gone
to
the
harbor
iago
ay
madam
desdemona
i
am
not
merry
but
i
do
beguile
the
thing
i
am
by
seeming
otherwise
come
how
wouldst
thou
praise
me
iago
i
am
about
it
but
indeed
my
invention
comes
from
my
pate
as
birdlime
does
from
frieze
it
plucks
out
brains
and
all
but
my
muse
labors
and
thus
she
is
deliverd
if
she
be
fair
and
wise
fairness
and
wit
the
ones
for
use
the
other
useth
it
desdemona
well
praised
how
if
she
be
black
and
witty
iago
if
she
be
black
and
thereto
have
a
wit
shell
find
a
white
that
shall
her
blackness
fit
desdemona
worse
and
worse
emilia
how
if
fair
and
foolish
iago
she
never
yet
was
foolish
that
was
fair
for
even
her
folly
helpd
her
to
an
heir
desdemona
these
are
old
fond
paradoxes
to
make
fools
laugh
i
the
alehouse
what
miserable
praise
hast
thou
for
her
thats
foul
and
foolish
iago
theres
none
so
foul
and
foolish
thereunto
but
does
foul
pranks
which
fair
and
wise
ones
do
desdemona
o
heavy
ignorance
thou
praisest
the
worst
best
but
what
praise
couldst
thou
bestow
on
a
deserving
woman
indeed
one
that
in
the
authority
of
her
merit
did
justly
put
on
the
vouch
of
very
malice
itself
iago
she
that
was
ever
fair
and
never
proud
had
tongue
at
will
and
yet
was
never
loud
never
lackd
gold
and
yet
went
never
gay
fled
from
her
wish
and
yet
said
now
i
may
she
that
being
angerd
her
revenge
being
nigh
bade
her
wrong
stay
and
her
displeasure
fly
she
that
in
wisdom
never
was
so
frail
to
change
the
cods
head
for
the
salmons
tail
she
that
could
think
and
neer
disclose
her
mind
see
suitors
following
and
not
look
behind
she
was
a
wight
if
ever
such
wight
were
desdemona
to
do
what
iago
to
suckle
fools
and
chronicle
small
beer
desdemona
o
most
lame
and
impotent
conclusion
do
not
learn
of
him
emilia
though
he
be
thy
husband
how
say
you
cassio
is
he
not
a
most
profane
and
liberal
counselor
cassio
he
speaks
home
madam
you
may
relish
him
more
in
the
soldier
than
in
the
scholar
iago
aside
he
takes
her
by
the
palm
ay
well
said
whisper
with
as
little
a
web
as
this
will
i
ensnare
as
great
a
fly
as
cassio
ay
smile
upon
her
do
i
will
gyve
thee
in
thine
own
courtship
you
say
true
tis
so
indeed
if
such
tricks
as
these
strip
you
out
of
your
lieutenantry
it
had
been
better
you
had
not
kissed
your
three
fingers
so
oft
which
now
again
you
are
most
apt
to
play
the
sir
in
very
good
well
kissed
an
excellent
courtesy
tis
so
indeed
yet
again
your
fingers
to
your
lips
would
they
were
clysterpipes
for
your
sake
trumpet
within
the
moor
i
know
his
trumpet

othello
o
my
fair
warrior
desdemona

















my
dear
othello
othello

gives
me
wonder
great
as
my
content
to
see
you
here
before
me
o
my
souls
joy
if
after
every
tempest
come
such
calms
may
the
winds
blow
till
they
have
wakend
death
and
let
the
laboring
bark
climb
hills
of
seas
olympushigh
and
duck
again
as
low
as
hells
from
heaven
if
it
were
now
to
die
twere
now
to
be
most
happy
for
i
fear
my
soul
hath
her
content
so
absolute
that
not
another
comfort
like
to
this
succeeds
in
unknown
fate
desdemona

















the
heavens
forbid
but
that
our
loves
and
comforts
should
increase
even
as
our
days
do
grow
othello



















amen
to
that
sweet
powers
i
cannot
speak
enough
of
this
content
it
stops
me
here
it
is
too
much
of
joy
and
this
and
this
the
greatest
discords
be









kisses
her
that
eer
our
hearts
shall
make
iago




















aside
o
you
are
well
tuned
now
but
ill
set
down
the
pegs
that
make
this

as
honest
as
i
am
othello












come
let
us
to
the
castle
news
friends
our
wars
are
done
the
turks
are
drownd
how
does
my
old
acquaintance
of
this
isle
honey
you
shall
be
well
desired
in
cyprus
i
have
found
great
love
amongst
them
o
my
sweet
i
prattle
out
of
fashion
and
i
dote
in
mine
own
comforts
i
prithee
good
iago
go
to
the
bay
and
disembark
my
coffers
bring
thou
the
master
to
the
citadel
he
is
a
good
one
and
his
worthiness
does
challenge
much
respect
come
desdemona
once
more
well
met
at
cyprus
exeunt
all
but
iago
and
roderigo
iago
do
thou
meet
me
presently
at
the
harbor
come
hither
if
thou
best
valiant
as
they
say
base
men
being
in
love
have
then
a
nobility
in
their
natures
more
than
is
native
to
them
list
me
the
lieutenant
tonight
watches
on
the
court
of
guard
first
i
must
tell
thee
this
desdemona
is
directly
in
love
with
him
roderigo
with
him
why
tis
not
possible
iago
lay
thy
finger
thus
and
let
thy
soul
be
instructed
mark
me
with
what
violence
she
first
loved
the
moor
but
for
bragging
and
telling
her
fantastical
lies
and
will
she
love
him
still
for
prating
let
not
thy
discreet
heart
think
it
her
eye
must
be
fed
and
what
delight
shall
she
have
to
look
on
the
devil
when
the
blood
is
made
dull
with
the
act
of
sport
there
should
be
again
to
inflame
it
and
to
give
satiety
a
fresh
appetite
loveliness
in
favor
sympathy
in
years
manners
and
beauties
all
which
the
moor
is
defective
in
now
for
want
of
these
required
conveniences
her
delicate
tenderness
will
find
itself
abused
begin
to
heave
the
gorge
disrelish
and
abhor
the
moor
very
nature
will
instruct
her
in
it
and
compel
her
to
some
second
choice
now
sir
this
granted
as
it
is
a
most
pregnant
and
unforced
position
who
stands
so
eminently
in
the
degree
of
this
fortune
as
cassio
does
a
knave
very
voluble
no
further
conscionable
than
in
putting
on
the
mere
form
of
civil
and
humane
seeming
for
the
better
compass
of
his
salt
and
most
hidden
loose
affection
why
none
why
none
a
slipper
and
subtle
knave
a
finder
out
of
occasions
that
has
an
eye
can
stamp
and
counterfeit
advantages
though
true
advantage
never
present
itself
a
devilish
knave
besides
the
knave
is
handsome
young
and
hath
all
those
requisites
in
him
that
folly
and
green
minds
look
after
a
pestilent
complete
knave
and
the
woman
hath
found
him
already
roderigo
i
cannot
believe
that
in
her
shes
full
of
most
blest
condition
iago
blest
figsend
the
wine
she
drinks
is
made
of
grapes
if
she
had
been
blest
she
would
never
have
loved
the
moor
blest
pudding
didst
thou
not
see
her
paddle
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
didst
not
mark
that
roderigo
yes
that
i
did
but
that
was
but
courtesy
iago
lechery
by
this
hand
an
index
and
obscure
prologue
to
the
history
of
lust
and
foul
thoughts
they
met
so
near
with
their
lips
that
their
breaths
embraced
together
villainous
thoughts
roderigo
when
these
mutualities
so
marshal
the
way
hard
at
hand
comes
the
master
and
main
exercise
the
incorporate
conclusion
pish
but
sir
be
you
ruled
by
me
i
have
brought
you
from
venice
watch
you
tonight
for
the
command
ill
layt
upon
you
cassio
knows
you
not
ill
not
be
far
from
you
do
you
find
some
occasion
to
anger
cassio
either
by
speaking
too
loud
or
tainting
his
discipline
or
from
what
other
course
you
please
which
the
time
shall
more
favorably
minister
roderigo
well
iago
sir
he
is
rash
and
very
sudden
in
choler
and
haply
may
strike
at
you
provoke
him
that
he
may
for
even
out
of
that
will
i
cause
these
of
cyprus
to
mutiny
whose
qualification
shall
come
into
no
true
taste
again
but
by
the
displanting
of
cassio
so
shall
you
have
a
shorter
journey
to
your
desires
by
the
means
i
shall
then
have
to
prefer
them
and
the
impediment
most
profitably
removed
without
the
which
there
were
no
expectation
of
our
prosperity
roderigo
i
will
do
this
if
i
can
bring
it
to
any
opportunity
iago
i
warrant
thee
meet
me
by
and
by
at
the
citadel
i
must
fetch
his
necessaries
ashore
farewell
roderigo
adieu













































exit
iago
that
cassio
loves
her
i
do
well
believe
it
that
she
loves
him
tis
apt
and
of
great
credit
the
moor
howbeit
that
i
endure
him
not
is
of
a
constant
loving
noble
nature
and
i
dare
think
hell
prove
to
desdemona
a
most
dear
husband
now
i
do
love
her
too
not
out
of
absolute
lust
though
peradventure
i
stand
accountant
for
as
great
a
sin
but
partly
led
to
diet
my
revenge
for
that
i
do
suspect
the
lusty
moor
hath
leapd
into
my
seat
the
thought
whereof
doth
like
a
poisonous
mineral
gnaw
my
inwards
and
nothing
can
or
shall
content
my
soul
till
i
am
evend
with
him
wife
for
wife
or
failing
so
yet
that
i
put
the
moor
at
least
into
a
jealousy
so
strong
that
judgement
cannot
cure
which
thing
to
do
if
this
poor
trash
of
venice
whom
i
trace
for
his
quick
hunting
stand
the
putting
on
ill
have
our
michael
cassio
on
the
hip
abuse
him
to
the
moor
in
the
rank
garb
for
i
fear
cassio
with
my
nightcap
too
make
the
moor
thank
me
love
me
and
reward
me
for
making
him
egregiously
an
ass
and
practicing
upon
his
peace
and
quiet
even
to
madness
tis
here
but
yet
confused
knaverys
plain
face
is
never
seen

cassio
i
pray
you
pardon
me
i
cannot
speak
othello
worthy
montano
you
were
wont
be
civil
the
gravity
and
stillness
of
your
youth
the
world
hath
noted
and
your
name
is
great
in
mouths
of
wisest
censure
whats
the
matter
that
you
unlace
your
reputation
thus
and
spend
your
rich
opinion
for
the
name
of
a
nightbrawler
give
me
answer
to
it
montano
worthy
othello
i
am
hurt
to
danger
your
officer
iago
can
inform
you
while
i
spare
speech
which
something
now
offends
me
of
all
that
i
do
know
nor
know
i
aught
by
me
thats
said
or
done
amiss
this
night
unless
selfcharity
be
sometimes
a
vice
and
to
defend
ourselves
it
be
a
sin
when
violence
assails
us
othello



















now
by
heaven
my
blood
begins
my
safer
guides
to
rule
and
passion
having
my
best
judgement
collied
assays
to
lead
the
way
if
i
once
stir
or
do
but
lift
this
arm
the
best
of
you
shall
sink
in
my
rebuke
give
me
to
know
how
this
foul
rout
began
who
set
it
on
and
he
that
is
approved
in
this
offense
though
he
had
twinnd
with
me
both
at
a
birth
shall
lose
me
what
in
a
town
of
war
yet
wild
the
peoples
hearts
brimful
of
fear
to
manage
private
and
domestic
quarrel
in
night
and
on
the
court
and
guard
of
safety
tis
monstrous
iago
who
begant
montano
if
partially
affined
or
leagued
in
office
thou
dost
deliver
more
or
less
than
truth
thou
art
no
soldier
iago

















touch
me
not
so
near
i
had
rather
have
this
tongue
cut
from
my
mouth
than
it
should
do
offense
to
michael
cassio
yet
i
persuade
myself
to
speak
the
truth
shall
nothing
wrong
him
thus
it
is
general
montano
and
myself
being
in
speech
there
comes
a
fellow
crying
out
for
help
and
cassio
following
him
with
determined
sword
to
execute
upon
him
sir
this
gentleman
steps
in
to
cassio
and
entreats
his
pause
myself
the
crying
fellow
did
pursue
lest
by
his
clamor
as
it
so
fell
out
the
town
might
fall
in
fright
he
swift
of
foot
outran
my
purpose
and
i
returnd
the
rather
for
that
i
heard
the
clink
and
fall
of
swords
and
cassio
high
in
oath
which
till
tonight
i
neer
might
say
before
when
i
came
back
for
this
was
brief
i
found
them
close
together
at
blow
and
thrust
even
as
again
they
were
when
you
yourself
did
part
them
more
of
this
matter
cannot
i
report
but
men
are
men
the
best
sometimes
forget
though
cassio
did
some
little
wrong
to
him
as
men
in
rage
strike
those
that
wish
them
best
yet
surely
cassio
i
believe
received
from
him
that
fled
some
strange
indignity
which
patience
could
not
pass
othello
























i
know
iago
thy
honesty
and
love
doth
mince
this
matter
making
it
light
to
cassio
cassio

iago
what
are
you

lieutenant
cassio
ay
past
all

iago
marry

forbid
cassio
reputation
reputation
reputation
o
i
have
lost
my
reputation
i
have
lost
the
immortal
part
of
myself
and
what
remains
is
bestial
my
reputation
iago
my
reputation
iago
as
i
am
an
honest
man
i
thought
you
had
received
some
bodily
wound
there
is
more
sense
in
that
than
in
reputation
reputation
is
an
idle
and
most
false
imposition
oft
got
without
merit
and
lost
without
deserving
you
have
lost
no
reputation
at
all
unless
you
repute
yourself
such
a
loser
what
man
there
are
ways
to
recover
the
general
again
you
are
but
now
cast
in
his
mood
a
punishment
more
in
policy
than
in
malice
even
so
as
one
would
beat
his
offenseless
dog
to
affright
an
imperious
lion
sue
to
him
again
and
hes
yours
cassio
i
will
rather
sue
to
be
despised
than
to
deceive
so
good
a
commander
with
so
slight
so
drunken
and
so
indiscreet
an
officer
drunk
and
speak
parrot
and
squabble
swagger
swear
and
discourse
fustian
with
ones
own
shadow
o
thou
invisible
spirit
of
wine
if
thou
hast
no
name
to
be
known
by
let
us
call
thee
devil
iago
what
was
he
that
you
followed
with
your
sword
what
had
he
done
to
you
cassio
i
know
not
iago
ist
possible
cassio
i
remember
a
mass
of
things
but
nothing
distinctly
a
quarrel
but
nothing
wherefore
o
god
that
men
should
put
an
enemy
in
their
mouths
to
steal
away
their
brains
that
we
should
with
joy
pleasance
revel
and
applause
transform
ourselves
into
beasts
iago
why
but
you
are
now
well
enough
how
came
you
thus
recovered
cassio
it
hath
pleased
the
devil
drunkenness
to
give
place
to
the
devil
wrath
one
unperfectness
shows
me
another
to
make
me
frankly
despise
myself
iago
come
you
are
too
severe
a
moraler
as
the
time
the
place
and
the
condition
of
this
country
stands
i
could
heartily
wish
this
had
not
befallen
but
since
it
is
as
it
is
mend
it
for
your
own
good
cassio
i
will
ask
him
for
my
place
again
he
shall
tell
me
i
am
a
drunkard
had
i
as
many
mouths
as
hydra
such
an
answer
would
stop
them
all
to
be
now
a
sensible
man
by
and
by
a
fool
and
presently
a
beast
o
strange
every
inordinate
cup
is
unblest
and
the
ingredient
is
a
devil
iago
come
come
good
wine
is
a
good
familiar
creature
if
it
be
well
used
exclaim
no
more
against
it
and
good
lieutenant
i
think
you
think
i
love
you

ill
tell
you
what
you
shall
do
our
generals
wife
is
now
the
general
i
may
say
so
in
this
respect
for
that
he
hath
devoted
and
given
up
himself
to
the
contemplation
mark
and
denotement
of
her
parts
and
graces
confess
yourself
freely
to
her
importune
her
help
to
put
you
in
your
place
again
she
is
of
so
free
so
kind
so
apt
so
blessed
a
disposition
she
holds
it
a
vice
in
her
goodness
not
to
do
more
than
she
is
requested
this
broken
joint
between
you
and
her
husband
entreat
her
to
splinter
and
my
fortunes
against
any
lay
worth
naming
this
crack
of
your
love
shall
grow
stronger
than
it
was
before
cassio
you
advise
me
well
iago
i
protest
in
the
sincerity
of
love
and
honest
kindness
cassio
i
think
it
freely
and
betimes
in
the
morning
i
will
beseech
the
virtuous
desdemona
to
undertake
for
me
i
am
desperate
of
my
fortunes
if
they
check
me
here
iago
you
are
in
the
right
good
night
lieutenant
i
must
to
the
watch

night

and
whats
he
then
that
says
i
play
the
villain
when
this
advice
is
free
i
give
and
honest
probal
to
thinking
and
indeed
the
course
to
win
the
moor
again
for
tis
most
easy
the
inclining
desdemona
to
subdue
in
any
honest
suit
shes
framed
as
fruitful
as
the
free
elements
and
then
for
her
to
win
the
moor
weret
to
renounce
his
baptism
all
seals
and
symbols
of
redeemed
sin
his
soul
is
so
enfetterd
to
her
love
that
she
may
make
unmake
do
what
she
list
even
as
her
appetite
shall
play
the
god
with
his
weak
function
how
am
i
then
a
villain
to
counsel
cassio
to
this
parallel
course
directly
to
his
good
divinity
of
hell
when
devils
will
the
blackest
sins
put
on
they
do
suggest
at
first
with
heavenly
shows
as
i
do
now
for
whiles
this
honest
fool
plies
desdemona
to
repair
his
fortune
and
she
for
him
pleads
strongly
to
the
moor
ill
pour
this
pestilence
into
his
ear
that
she
repeals
him
for
her
bodys
lust
and
by
how
much
she
strives
to
do
him
good
she
shall
undo
her
credit
with
the
moor
so
will
i
turn
her
virtue
into
pitch
and
out
of
her
own
goodness
make
the
net
that
shall
enmesh
them
all

enter

how
now
roderigo
roderigo
i
do
follow
here
in
the
chase
not
like
a
hound
that
hunts

one
that
fills
up
the
cry
my
money
is
almost
spent
i
have
been
tonight
exceedingly
well
cudgeled
and
i
think
the
issue
will
be
i
shall
have
so
much
experience
for
my
pains
and
so
with
no
money
at
all
and
a
little
more
wit
return
again
to
venice
iago
how
poor
are
they
that
have
not
patience
what
wound
did
ever
heal
but
by
degrees
thou
knowst
we
work
by
wit
and
not
by
witchcraft
and
wit
depends
on
dilatory
time
doest
not
go
well
cassio
hath
beaten
thee
and
thou
by
that
small
hurt
hast
cashierd
cassio
though
other
things
grow
fair
against
the
sun
yet
fruits
that
blossom
first
will
first
be
ripe
content

mass
tis
morning
pleasure
and

where
thou
art
billeted

say
thou
shalt
know
more
hereafter

get
thee
gone

things
are
to
be
done

wife
must
move

a
man
that
languishes
in
your
displeasure
othello
who
ist
you
mean
desdemona
why
your
lieutenant
cassio
good
my
lord
if
i
have
any
grace
or
power
to
move
you
his
present
reconciliation
take
for
if
he
be
not
one
that
truly
loves
you
that
errs
in
ignorance
and
not
in
cunning
i
have
no
judgement
in
an
honest
face
i
prithee
call
him
back
othello



















went
he
hence
now
desdemona
ay
sooth
so
humbled
that
he
hath
left
part
of
his
grief
with
me
to
suffer
with
him
good
love
call
him
back
othello
not
now
sweet
desdemona
some
other
time
desdemona
but
shallt
be
shortly
othello


























the
sooner
sweet
for
you
desdemona
shallt
be
tonight
at
supper
othello
































no
not
tonight
desdemona
tomorrow
dinner
then
othello
























i
shall
not
dine
at
home
i
meet
the
captains
at
the
citadel
desdemona
why
then
tomorrow
night
or
tuesday
morn
on
tuesday
noon
or
night
on
wednesday
morn
i
prithee
name
the
time
but
let
it
not
exceed
three
days
in
faith
hes
penitent
and
yet
his
trespass
in
our
common
reason
save
that
they
say
the
wars
must
make
example
out
of
their
best
is
not
almost
a
fault
to
incur
a
private
check
when
shall
he
come
tell
me
othello
i
wonder
in
my
soul
what
you
would
ask
me
that
i
should
deny
or
stand
so
mammering
on
what
michael
cassio
that
came
awooing
with
you
and
so
many
a
time
when
i
have
spoke
of
you
dispraisingly
hath
taen
your
part
to
have
so
much
to
do
to
bring
him
in
trust
me
i
could
do
much
othello
prithee
no
more
let
him
come
when
he
will
i
will
deny
thee
nothing
desdemona

















why
this
is
not
a
boon
tis
as
i
should
entreat
you
wear
your
gloves
or
feed
on
nourishing
dishes
or
keep
you
warm
or
sue
to
you
to
do
a
peculiar
profit
to
your
own
person
nay
when
i
have
a
suit
wherein
i
mean
to
touch
your
love
indeed
it
shall
be
full
of
poise
and
difficult
weight
and
fearful
to
be
granted
othello




















i
will
deny
thee
nothing
whereon
i
do
beseech
thee
grant
me
this
to
leave
me
but
a
little
to
myself
desdemona
shall
i
deny
you
no
farewell
my
lord
othello
farewell
my
desdemona
ill
come
to
thee
straight
desdemona
emilia
come
be
as
your
fancies
teach
you
whateer
you
be
i
am
obedient
exeunt
desdemona
and
emilia
othello
excellent
wretch
perdition
catch
my
soul
but
i
do
love
thee
and
when
i
love
thee
not
chaos
is
come
again
iago
my
noble
lord
othello












what
dost
thou
say
iago
iago
did
michael
cassio
when
you
wood
my
lady
know
of
your
love
othello
he
did
from
first
to
last
why
dost
thou
ask
iago
but
for
a
satisfaction
of
my
thought
no
further
harm
othello










why
of
thy
thought
iago
iago
i
did
not
think
he
had
been
acquainted
with
her
othello
o
yes
and
went
between
us
very
oft
iago
indeed
othello
indeed
ay
indeed
discernst
thou
aught
in
that
is
he
not
honest
iago
honest
my
lord
othello
honest
ay
honest
iago
my
lord
for
aught
i
know
othello
what
dost
thou
think
iago
think
my
lord
othello
think
my
lord
by
heaven
he
echoes
me
as
if
there
were
some
monster
in
his
thought
too
hideous
to
be
shown
thou
dost
mean
something
i
heard
thee
say
even
now
thou
likest
not
that
when
cassio
left
my
wife
what
didst
not
like
and
when
i
told
thee
he
was
of
my
counsel
in
my
whole
course
of
wooing
thou
criedst
indeed
and
didst
contract
and
purse
thy
brow
together
as
if
thou
then
hadst
shut
up
in
thy
brain
some
horrible
conceit
if
thou
dost
love
me
show
me
thy
thought
iago
my
lord
you
know
i
love
you
othello



























i
think
thou
dost
and
for
i
know
thourt
full
of
love
and
honesty
and
weighst
thy
words
before
thou
givest
them
breath
therefore
these
stops
of
thine
fright
me
the
more
for
such
things
in
a
false
disloyal
knave
are
tricks
of
custom
but
in
a
man
thats
just
theyre
close
dilations
working
from
the
heart
that
passion
cannot
rule
iago






















for
michael
cassio
i
dare
be
sworn
i
think
that
he
is
honest
othello
i
think
so
too
iago



















men
should
be
what
they
seem
or
those
that
be
not
would
they
might
seem
none
othello
certain
men
should
be
what
they
seem
iago
why
then
i
think
cassios
an
honest
man
othello
nay
yet
theres
more
in
this
i
prithee
speak
to
me
as
to
thy
thinkings
as
thou
dost
ruminate
and
give
thy
worst
of
thoughts
the
worst
of
words
iago
















good
my
lord
pardon
me
though
i
am
bound
to
every
act
of
duty
i
am
not
bound
to
that
all
slaves
are
free
to
utter
my
thoughts
why
say
they
are
vile
and
false
as
wheres
that
palace
whereinto
foul
things
sometimes
intrude
not
who
has
a
breast
so
pure
but
some
uncleanly
apprehensions
keep
leets
and
lawdays
and
in
session
sit
with
meditations
lawful
othello
thou
dost
conspire
against
thy
friend
iago
if
thou
but
thinkst
him
wrongd
and
makest
his
ear
a
stranger
to
thy
thoughts
iago
























i
do
beseech
you
though
i
perchance
am
vicious
in
my
guess
as
i
confess
it
is
my
natures
plague
to
spy
into
abuses
and
oft
my
jealousy
shapes
faults
that
are
not
that
your
wisdom
yet
from
one
that
so
imperfectly
conceits
would
take
no
notice
nor
build
yourself
a
trouble
out
of
his
scattering
and
unsure
observance
it
were
not
for
your
quiet
nor
your
good
nor
for
my
manhood
honesty
or
wisdom
to
let
you
know
my
thoughts
othello






















what
dost
thou
mean
iago
good
name
in
man
and
woman
dear
my
lord
is
the
immediate
jewel
of
their
souls
who
steals
my
purse
steals
trash
tis
something
nothing
twas
mine
tis
his
and
has
been
slave
to
thousands
but
he
that
filches
from
me
my
good
name
robs
me
of
that
which
not
enriches
him
and
makes
me
poor
indeed
othello
by
heaven
ill
know
thy
thoughts
iago
you
cannot
if
my
heart
were
in
your
hand
nor
shall
not
whilst
tis
in
my
custody
othello
ha
iago







o
beware
my
lord
of
jealousy
it
is
the
greeneyed
monster
which
doth
mock
the
meat
it
feeds
on
that
cuckold
lives
in
bliss
who
certain
of
his
fate
loves
not
his
wronger
but
o
what
damned
minutes
tells
he
oer
who
dotes
yet
doubts
suspects
yet
strongly
loves
othello
o
misery
iago
poor
and
content
is
rich
and
rich
enough
but
riches
fineless
is
as
poor
as
winter
to
him
that
ever
fears
he
shall
be
poor
good
heaven
the
souls
of
all
my
tribe
defend
from
jealousy
othello








why
why
is
this
thinkst
thou
ild
make
a
life
of
jealousy
to
follow
still
the
changes
of
the
moon
with
fresh
suspicions
no
to
be
once
in
doubt
is
once
to
be
resolved
exchange
me
for
a
goat
when
i
shall
turn
the
business
of
my
soul
to
such
exsufflicate
and
blown
surmises
matching
thy
inference
tis
not
to
make
me
jealous
to
say
my
wife
is
fair
feeds
well
loves
company
is
free
of
speech
sings
plays
and
dances
well
where
virtue
is
these
are
more
virtuous
nor
from
mine
own
weak
merits
will
i
draw
the
smallest
fear
or
doubt
of
her
revolt
for
she
had
eyes
and
chose
me
no
iago
ill
see
before
i
doubt
when
i
doubt
prove
and
on
the
proof
there
is
no
more
but
this
away
at
once
with
love
or
jealousy
iago
i
am
glad
of
it
for
now
i
shall
have
reason
to
show
the
love
and
duty
that
i
bear
you
with
franker
spirit
therefore
as
i
am
bound
receive
it
from
me
i
speak
not
yet
of
proof
look
to
your
wife
observe
her
well
with
cassio
wear
your
eye
thus
not
jealous
nor
secure
i
would
not
have
your
free
and
noble
nature
out
of
selfbounty
be
abused
look
tot
i
know
our
country
disposition
well
in
venice
they
do
let
heaven
see
the
pranks
they
dare
not
show
their
husbands
their
best
conscience
is
not
to
leavet
undone
but
keept
unknown
othello
dost
thou
say
so
iago
she
did
deceive
her
father
marrying
you
and
when
she
seemd
to
shake
and
fear
your
looks
she
loved
them
most
othello














and
so
she
did
iago

































why
go
to
then
she
that
so
young
could
give
out
such
a
seeming
to
seel
her
fathers
eyes
up
close
as
oak
he
thought
twas
witchcraft
but
i
am
much
to
blame
i
humbly
do
beseech
you
of
your
pardon
for
too
much
loving
you
othello


















i
am
bound
to
thee
forever
iago
i
see
this
hath
a
little
dashd
your
spirits
othello
not
a
jot
not
a
jot
iago

























ifaith
i
fear
it
has
i
hope
you
will
consider
what
is
spoke
comes
from
my
love
but
i
do
see
youre
moved
i
am
to
pray
you
not
to
strain
my
speech
to
grosser
issues
nor
to
larger
reach
than
to
suspicion
othello
i
will
not
iago















should
you
do
so
my
lord
my
speech
should
fall
into
such
vile
success
which
my
thoughts
aim
not
at
cassios
my
worthy
friend
my
lord
i
see
youre
moved
othello






















no
not
much
moved
i
do
not
think
but
desdemonas
honest
iago
long
live
she
so
and
long
live
you
to
think
so
othello
and
yet
how
nature
erring
from
itself
iago
ay
theres
the
point
as
to
be
bold
with
you
not
to
affect
many
proposed
matches
of
her
own
clime
complexion
and
degree
whereto
we
see
in
all
things
nature
tends
foh
one
may
smell
in
such
a
will
most
rank
foul
disproportion
thoughts
unnatural
but
pardon
me
i
do
not
in
position
distinctly
speak
of
her
though
i
may
fear
her
will
recoiling
to
her
better
judgement
may
fall
to
match
you
with
her
country
forms
and
happily
repent
othello













farewell
farewell
if
more
thou
dost
perceive
let
me
know
more
set
on
thy
wife
to
observe
leave
me
iago
iago
going
my
lord
i
take
my
leave
othello
why
did
i
marry
this
honest
creature
doubtless
sees
and
knows
more
much
more
than
he
unfolds
iago
returning
my
lord
i
would
i
might
entreat
your
honor
to
scan
this
thing
no
further
leave
it
to
time
though
it
be
fit
that
cassio
have
his
place
for
sure
he
fills
it
up
with
great
ability
yet
if
you
please
to
hold
him
off
awhile
you
shall
by
that
perceive
him
and
his
means
note
if
your
lady
strain
his
entertainment
with
any
strong
or
vehement
importunity
much
will
be
seen
in
that
in
the
meantime
let
me
be
thought
too
busy
in
my
fears
as
worthy
cause
i
have
to
fear
i
am
and
hold
her
free
i
do
beseech
your
honor
othello
fear
not
my
government
iago
i
once
more
take
my
leave





























exit
othello
this
fellows
of
exceeding
honesty
and
knows
all
qualities
with
a
learned
spirit
of
human
dealings
if
i
do
prove
her
haggard
though
that
her
jesses
were
my
dear
heartstrings
ild
whistle
her
off
and
let
her
down
the
wind
to
prey
at
fortune
haply
for
i
am
black
and
have
not
those
soft
parts
of
conversation
that
chamberers
have
or
for
i
am
declined
into
the
vale
of
years
yet
thats
not
much
shes
gone
i
am
abused
and
my
relief
must
be
to
loathe
her
o
curse
of
marriage
that
we
can
call
these
delicate
creatures
ours
and
not
their
appetites
i
had
rather
be
a
toad
and
live
upon
the
vapor
of
a
dungeon
than
keep
a
corner
in
the
thing
i
love
for
others
uses
yet
tis
the
plague
of
great
ones
prerogatived
are
they
less
than
the
base
tis
destiny
unshunnable
like
death
even
then
this
forked
plague
is
fated
to
us
when
we
do
quicken
desdemona
comes

reenter
desdemona
and
emilia

if
she
be
false
o
then
heaven
mocks
itself

moor
my
wayward
husband

a
hundred
times
wood

to
steal

but
she
so
loves
the
token

reserves
it
evermore
about

emilia

in
cassios
lodging
lose
this
napkin
and
let
him
find
it
trifles
light
as
air
are
to
the
jealous
confirmations
strong
as
proofs
of
holy
writ
this
may
do
something
the
moor
already
changes
with
my
poison
dangerous
conceits
are
in
their
natures
poisons
which
at
the
first
are
scarce
found
to
distaste
but
with
a
little
act
upon
the
blood
burn
like
the
mines
of
sulphur
i
did
say
so
look
where
he
comes

reenter
othello

not
poppy
nor
mandragora
nor
all
the
drowsy
syrups
of
the
world
shall
ever
medicine
thee

sweet
sleep
which
thou
owedst
yesterday
othello

that
othello
avaunt

gone
thou
hast
set
me
on
the
rack

swear
tis
better
to
be
much
abused
than
but
to
knowt
a
little
iago

























how
now
my
lord
othello
what
sense
had
i
of
her
stoln
hours
of
lust

not
me
i
slept
the

iago
i
am
sorry
to

this
othello
i
had
been
happy
if

tasted
her
sweet
body
so
i
had
nothing
known
o
now
forever
farewell

my
lord
othello
villain
be
sure
thou
prove
my
love
a
whore
be
sure
of
it
give
me
the
ocular
proof
or
by
the
worth
of
mans
eternal
soul
thou
hadst
been
better
have
been
born
a
dog
than
answer
my
waked
wrath
iago
























ist
come
to
this
othello
make
me
to
seet
or
at
the
least
so
prove
it
that
the
probation
bear
no
hinge
nor
loop
to
hang
a
doubt
on
or
woe
upon
thy
life
iago
my
noble
lord
othello
if
thou
dost
slander
her
and
torture
me
never
pray
more
abandon
all
remorse
on
horrors
head
horrors
accumulate
do
deeds
to
make
heaven
weep
all
earth
amazed
for
nothing
canst
thou
to
damnation
add
greater
than
that
iago















o
grace
o
heaven
defend
me
are
you
a
man
have
you
a
soul
or
sense
god
be
wi
you
take
mine
office
o
wretched
fool
that
livest
to
make
thine
honesty
a
vice
o
monstrous
world
take
note
take
note
o
world
to
be
direct
and
honest
is
not
safe
i
thank
you
for
this
profit
and
from
hence
ill
love
no
friend
sith
love
breeds
such
offense
othello
nay
stay
thou
shouldst
be
honest
iago
i
should
be
wise
for
honestys
a
fool
and
loses
that
it
works
for
othello






















by
the
world
i
think
my
wife
be
honest
and
think
she
is
not
i
think
that
thou
art
just
and
think
thou
art
not
ill
have
some
proof
her
name
that
was
as
fresh
as
dians
visage
is
now
begrimed
and
black
as
mine
own
face
if
there
be
cords
or
knives
poison
or
fire
or
suffocating
streams
ill
not
endure
it
would
i
were
satisfied
iago
i
see
sir
you
are
eaten
up
with
passion
i
do
repent
me
that
i
put
it
to
you
you
would
be
satisfied
othello

















would
nay
i
will
iago
and
may
but
how
how
satisfied
my
lord
would
you
the
supervisor
grossly
gape
on
behold
her
toppd
othello












death
and
damnation
o
iago
it
were
a
tedious
difficulty
i
think
to
bring
them
to
that
prospect
damn
them
then
if
ever
mortal
eyes
do
see
them
bolster
more
than
their
own
what
then
how
then
what
shall
i
say
wheres
satisfaction
it
is
impossible
you
should
see
this
were
they
as
prime
as
goats
as
hot
as
monkeys
as
salt
as
wolves
in
pride
and
fools
as
gross
as
ignorance
made
drunk
but
yet
i
say
if
imputation
and
strong
circumstances
which
lead
directly
to
the
door
of
truth
will
give
you
satisfaction
you
may
havet
othello
give
me
a
living
reason
shes
disloyal
iago
i
do
not
like
the
office
but
sith
i
am
enterd
in
this
cause
so
far
prickd
tot
by
foolish
honesty
and
love
i
will
go
on
i
lay
with
cassio
lately
and
being
troubled
with
a
raging
tooth
i
could
not
sleep
there
are
a
kind
of
men
so
loose
of
soul
that
in
their
sleeps
will
mutter
their
affairs
one
of
this
kind
is
cassio
in
sleep
i
heard
him
say
sweet
desdemona
let
us
be
wary
let
us
hide
our
loves
and
then
sir
would
he
gripe
and
wring
my
hand
cry
o
sweet
creature
and
then
kiss
me
hard
as
if
he
pluckd
up
kisses
by
the
roots
that
grew
upon
my
lips
then
laid
his
leg
over
my
thigh
and
sighd
and
kissd
and
then
cried
cursed
fate
that
gave
thee
to
the
moor
othello
o
monstrous
monstrous
iago



























nay
this
was
but
his
dream
othello
but
this
denoted
a
foregone
conclusion
tis
a
shrewd
doubt
though
it
be
but
a
dream
iago
and
this
may
help
to
thicken
other
proofs
that
do
demonstrate
thinly
othello





















ill
tear
her
all
to
pieces
iago
nay
but
be
wise
yet
we
see
nothing
done
she
may
be
honest
yet
tell
me
but
this
have
you
not
sometimes
seen
a
handkerchief
spotted
with
strawberries
in
your
wifes
hand
othello
i
gave
her
such
a
one
twas
my
first
gift
iago
i
know
not
that
but
such
a
handkerchief
i
am
sure
it
was
your
wifes
did
i
today
see
cassio
wipe
his
beard
with
othello

























if
it
be
that
iago
if
it
be
that
or
any
that
was
hers
it
speaks
against
her
with
the
other
proofs
othello
o
that
the
slave
had
forty
thousand
lives
one
is
too
poor
too
weak
for
my
revenge
now
do
i
see
tis
true
look
here
iago
all
my
fond
love
thus
do
i
blow
to
heaven
tis
gone
arise
black
vengeance
from
thy
hollow
hell
yield
up
o
love
thy
crown
and
hearted
throne
to
tyrannous
hate
swell
bosom
with
thy
fraught
for
tis
of
aspics
tongues
iago

























yet
be
content
othello
o
blood
blood
blood
iago
patience
i
say
your
mind
perhaps
may
change
othello
never
iago
like
to
the
pontic
sea
whose
icy
current
and
compulsive
course
neer
feels
retiring
ebb
but
keeps
due
on
to
the
propontic
and
the
hellespont
even
so
my
bloody
thoughts
with
violent
pace
shall
neer
look
back
neer
ebb
to
humble
love
till
that
a
capable
and
wide
revenge
swallow
them
up
now
by
yond
marble
heaven
in
the
due
reverence
of
a
sacred
vow





















kneels
i
here
engage
my
words
iago




















do
not
rise
yet

















kneels
witness
you
everburning
lights
above
you
elements
that
clip
us
round
about
witness
that
here
iago
doth
give
up
the
execution
of
his
wit
hands
heart
to
wrongd
othellos
service
let
him
command
and
to
obey
shall
be
in
me
remorse
what
bloody
business
ever




























they
rise
othello




















i
greet
thy
love
not
with
vain
thanks
but
with
acceptance
bounteous
and
will
upon
the
instant
put
thee
tot
within
these
three
days
let
me
hear
thee
say
that
cassios
not
alive
iago
my
friend
is
dead
tis
done
at
your
request
but
let
her
live
othello











damn
her
lewd
minx
o
damn
her
come
go
with
me
apart
i
will
withdraw
to
furnish
me
with
some
swift
means
of
death
for

emilia
emilia
i

not
madam
desdemona
believe
me
i
had
rather
have
lost
my
purse
full
of
crusadoes
and
but
my
noble
moor
is
true
of
mind
and
made
of
no
such
baseness
as
jealous
creatures
are
it
were
enough
to
put
him
to
ill
thinking
emilia






















is
he
not
jealous
desdemona
who
he
i
think
the
sun
where
he
was
born
drew
all
such
humors
from
him
emilia

























look
where
he
comes
desdemona
i
will
not

him
now
till
cassio

ist
with
you
my
lord

good
lady
aside
o
hardness
to
dissemble
how
do
you
desdemona
desdemona














well
my
good
lord
othello
give
me
your
hand
this
hand
is
moist
my
lady
desdemona
it
yet
has
felt
no
age
nor
known
no
sorrow
othello
this
argues
fruitfulness
and
liberal
heart
hot
hot
and
moist
this
hand
of
yours
requires
a
sequester
from
liberty
fasting
and
prayer
much
castigation
exercise
devout
for
heres
a
young
and
sweating
devil
here
that
commonly
rebels
tis
a
good
hand
a
frank
one
desdemona
you
may
indeed
say
so
for
twas
that
hand
that
gave
away
my
heart
othello
a
liberal
hand
the
hearts
of
old
gave
hands
but
our
new
heraldry
is
hands
not
hearts
desdemona
i
cannot
speak
of
this
come
now
your
promise
othello
what
promise
chuck
desdemona
i
have
sent
to
bid
cassio
come
speak
with
you
othello
i
have
a
salt
and
sorry
rheum
offends
me
lend
me
thy
handkerchief
desdemona
here
my
lord
othello
that
which
i
gave
you
desdemona
i
have
it
not
about
me
othello
not
desdemona
no
faith
my
lord
othello
thats
a
fault
that
handkerchief
did
an
egyptian
to
my
mother
give
she
was
a
charmer
and
could
almost
read
the
thoughts
of
people
she
told
her
while
she
kept
it
twould
make
her
amiable
and
subdue
my
father
entirely
to
her
love
but
if
she
lost
it
or
made
a
gift
of
it
my
fathers
eye
should
hold
her
loathed
and
his
spirits
should
hunt
after
new
fancies
she
dying
gave
it
me
and
bid
me
when
my
fate
would
have
me
wive
to
give
it
her
i
did
so
and
take
heed
ont
make
it
a
darling
like
your
precious
eye
to
loset
or
givet
away
were
such
perdition
as
nothing
else
could
match
desdemona




















ist
possible
othello
tis
true

magic
in
the
web
of
it
a
sibyl
that
had
numberd
in
the
world
the
sun
to
course
two
hundred
compasses
in
her
prophetic
fury
sewd
the
work
the
worms
were
hallowd
that
did
breed
the
silk
and
it
was
dyed
in
mummy
which
the
skillful
conserved
of
maidens
hearts
desdemona





















indeed
ist
true
othello

veritable

theres
some
wonder
in
this
handkerchief
i
am
most
unhappy
in
the
loss
of
it
emilia
tis
not
a
year
or
two
shows
us
a
man
they
are
all
but
stomachs
and
we
all
but
food
they
eat
us
hungerly
and
when
they
are
full
they
belch
us
look
you
cassio
and
my
husband

enter
cassio
and
iago

iago
there

i
do
beseech
you
that
by
your
virtuous
means
i
may
again
exist
and
be
a
member
of
his
love
whom
i
with
all
the
office
of
my
heart
entirely
honor
i
would
not
be
delayd
if
my
offense
be
of
such
mortal
kind
that
nor
my
service
past
nor
present
sorrows
nor
purposed
merit
in
futurity
can
ransom
me
into
his
love
again
but
to
know
so
must
be
my
benefit
so
shall
i
clothe
me
in
a
forced
content
and
shut
myself
up
in
some
other
course
to
fortunes
alms
desdemona










alas
thricegentle
cassio
my
advocation
is
not
now
in
tune
my
lord
is
not
my
lord
nor
should
i
know
him
were
he
in
favor
as
in
humor
alterd
so
help
me
every
spirit
sanctified
as
i
have
spoken
for
you
all
my
best
and
stood
within
the
blank
of
his
displeasure
for
my
free
speech
you
must
awhile
be
patient
what
i
can
do
i
will
and
more
i
will
than
for
myself
i
dare
let
that
suffice
you
iago
is
my
lord
angry
emilia
















he
went
hence
but
now
and
certainly
in
strange
unquietness
iago
can
he
be
angry
i
have
seen
the
cannon
when
it
hath
blown
his
ranks
into
the
air
and
like
the
devil
from
his
very
arm
puffd
his
own
brother
and
can
he
be
angry
something
of
moment
then
i
will
go
meet
him
theres
matter
int
indeed
if
he
be
angry
desdemona
i
prithee
do
so




























exit
iago
something
sure
of
state
either
from
venice
or
some
unhatchd
practice
made
demonstrable
here
in
cyprus
to
him
hath
puddled
his
clear
spirit
and
in
such
cases
mens
natures
wrangle
with
inferior
things
though
great
ones
are
their
object
tis
even
so
for
let
our
finger
ache
and
it
indues
our
other
healthful
members
even
to
that
sense
of
pain
nay
we
must
think
men
are
not
gods
nor
of
them
look
for
such
observancy
as
fits
the
bridal
beshrew
me
much
emilia
i
was
unhandsome
warrior
as
i
am
arraigning
his
unkindness

no
jealous
toy
concerning

stand
you
awhile
apart
confine
yourself
but
in
a
patient
list
whilst
you
were
here
oerwhelmed
with
your
grief
a
passion
most
unsuiting
such
a
man
cassio
came
hither
i
shifted
him
away
and
laid
good
scuse
upon
your
ecstasy
bade
him
anon
return
and
here
speak
with
me
the
which
he
promised
do
but
encave
yourself
and
mark
the
fleers
the
gibes
and
notable
scorns
that
dwell
in
every
region
of
his
face
for
i
will
make
him
tell
the
tale
anew
where
how
how
oft
how
long
ago
and
when
he
hath
and
is
again
to
cope
your
wife
i
say
but
mark
his
gesture
marry
patience
or
i
shall
say
you
are
all
in
all
in
spleen
and
nothing
of
a
man
othello















dost
thou
hear
iago
i
will
be
found
most
cunning
in
my
patience
but
dost
thou
hear
most
bloody
iago

a
creature
that
dotes
on
cassio
as

the
strumpets
plague
to
beguile
many
and
be
beguiled
by
one
he
when
he
hears
of

cannot
refrain
from
the
excess
of
laughter
here
he
comes

reenter
cassio

as
he
shall
smile
othello
shall
go
mad
and
his
unbookish
jealousy

construe
poor
cassios
smiles
gestures
and
light
behavior
quite
in
the
wrong

his

courses
will
denote
him
so

mass
of
vanity

i
pray
you

in
the
contrary
roderigo
every
day
thou
daffest
me
with
some
device
iago
and
rather
as
it
seems
to
me
now
keepest
from
me
all
conveniency
than
suppliest
me
with
the
least
advantage
of
hope
i
will
indeed
no
longer
endure
it
nor
am
i
yet
persuaded
to
put
up
in
peace
what
already
i
have
foolishly
suffered
iago

you
hear
me
roderigo
roderigo
faith

heard
too
much
for
your
words
and
performances

no
kin
together
iago
you
charge
me
most
unjustly
roderigo
with
nought
but
truth
i
have
wasted
myself
out
of
my
means
the
jewels
you
have
had
from
me
to
deliver
to
desdemona
would
half
have
corrupted
a
votarist
you
have
told
me
she
hath
received
them
and
returned
me
expectations
and
comforts
of
sudden
respect
and
acquaintance
but
i
find
none
iago
well
go
to
very
well
roderigo
very
well
go
to
i
cannot
go
to
man
nor
tis
not
very
well
by
this
hand
i
say
tis
very
scurvy
and
begin
to
find
myself
fopped
in
it
iago
very
well
roderigo
i
tell
you
tis
not
very
well
i
will
make
myself
known
to
desdemona
if
she
will
return
me
my
jewels
i
will
give
over
my
suit
and
repent
my
unlawful
solicitation
if
not
assure
yourself
i
will
seek
satisfaction
of
you
iago
you
have
said
now
roderigo
ay
and
said
nothing
but
what
i
protest
intendment
of
doing
iago
why
now
i
see
theres
mettle
in
thee
and
even
from
this
instant
do
build
on
thee
a
better
opinion
than
ever
before
give
me
thy
hand
roderigo
thou
hast
taken
against
me
a
most
just
exception
but
yet
i
protest
have
dealt
most
directly
in
thy
affair
roderigo
it
hath
not
appeared
iago
i
grant
indeed
it
hath
not
appeared
and
your
suspicion
is
not
without
wit
and
judgement
but
roderigo
if
thou
hast
that
in
thee
indeed
which
i
have
greater
reason
to
believe
now
than
ever
i
mean
purpose
courage
and
valor
this
night
show
it
if
thou
the
next
night
following
enjoy
not
desdemona
take
me
from
this
world
with
treachery
and
devise
engines
for
my
life
roderigo
well
what
is
it
is
it
within
reason
and
compass
iago
sir
there
is
especial
commission
come
from
venice
to
depute
cassio
in
othellos
place
roderigo
is
that
true
why
then
othello
and
desdemona
return
again
to
venice
iago
o
no
he
goes
into
mauritania
and
takes
away
with
him
the
fair
desdemona
unless
his
abode
be
lingered
here
by
some
accident
wherein
none
can
be
so
determinate
as
the
removing
of
cassio
roderigo
how
do
you
mean
removing
of
him
iago
why
by
making
him
uncapable
of
othellos
place
knocking
out
his
brains
roderigo
and
that
you
would
have
me
to
do
iago
ay
if
you
dare
do
yourself
a
profit
and
a
right
he
sups
tonight
with
a
harlotry
and
thither
will
i
go
to
him
he
knows
not
yet
of
his
honorable
fortune
if
you
will
watch
his
going
thence
which
his
will
fashion
to
fall
out
between
twelve
and
one
you
may
take
him
at
your
pleasure
i
will
be
near
to
second
your
attempt
and
he
shall
fall
between
us
come
stand
not
amazed
at
it
but
go
along
with
me
i
will
show
you
such
a
necessity
in
his
death
that
you
shall
think
yourself
bound
to
put
it
on
him
it
is
now
high
suppertime
and
the
night
grows
to
waste
about
it
roderigo
i
will
hear
further
reason
for
this
iago
and
you
shall
be
satisfied

the
worlds
a
huge
thing
it
is
a
great
price
for
a
small
vice
desdemona









in
troth
i
think
thou
wouldst
not
emilia
in
troth
i
think
i
should
and
undot
when
i
had
done
marry
i
would
not
do
such
a
thing
for
a
jointring
nor
for
measures
of
lawn
nor
for
gowns
petticoats
nor
caps
nor
any
petty
exhibition
but
for
the
whole
world
why
who
would
not
make
her
husband
a
cuckold
to
make
him
a
monarch
i
should
venture
purgatory
fort
desdemona
beshrew
me
if
i
would
do
such
a
wrong
for
the
whole
world
emilia
why
the
wrong
is
but
a
wrong
i
the
world
and
having
the
world
for
your
labor
tis
a
wrong
in
your
own
world
and
you
might
quickly
make
it
right
desdemona
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
such
woman
emilia
yes
a
dozen
and
as
many
to
the
vantage
as
would
store
the
world
they
played
for
but
i
do
think
it
is
their
husbands
faults
if
wives
do
fall
say
that
they
slack
their
duties
and
pour
our
treasures
into
foreign
laps
or
else
break
out
in
peevish
jealousies
throwing
restraint
upon
us
or
say
they
strike
us
or
scant
our
former
having
in
despite
why
we
have
galls
and
though
we
have
some
grace
yet
have
we
some
revenge
let
husbands
know
their
wives
have
sense
like
them
they
see
and
smell
and
have
their
palates
both
for
sweet
and
sour
as
husbands
have
what
is
it
that
they
do
when
they
change
us
for

is
it
sport
i

it
is

doth

that
thus
errs
it
is
so
too
and
have
not
we

desires
for

and
frailty
as

have
then
let

here
another
the
one
of
them
imports
the
death
of
cassio
to
be
undertook
by
roderigo
othello
o
villain
cassio












most
heathenish
and
most
gross
lodovico
now
heres
another
discontented
paper
found
in
his
pocket
too
and
this
it
seems
roderigo
meant
to
have
sent
this
damned
villain
but
that
belike
iago
in
the
interim
came
in
and
satisfied
him
othello




















o
the
pernicious
caitiff
how
came
you
cassio
by
that
handkerchief
that
was
my
wifes
cassio














i
found
it
in
my
chamber
and
he
himself
confessd
but
even
now
that
there
he
droppd
it
for
a
special
purpose
which
wrought
to
his
desire
othello






















o
fool
fool
fool
cassio
there
is
besides
in
roderigos
letter
how
he
upbraids
iago
that
he
made
him
brave
me
upon
the
watch
whereon
it
came
that
i
was
cast
and
even
but
now
he
spake
after
long
seeming
dead
iago
hurt
him
iago
set
him
on
lodovico
you
must
forsake
this
room
and
go
with
us
your
power
and
your
command
is
taken
off
and
cassio
rules
in
cyprus
for
this
slave
if
there
be
any
cunning
cruelty
that
can
torment
him
much
and
hold
him
long
it
shall
be
his
you
shall
close
prisoner
rest
till
that
the
nature
of
your
fault
be
known
to
the
venetian
state
come
bring
away
othello
soft
you
a
word
or
two
before
you
go
i
have
done
the
state
some
service
and
they
knowt
no
more
of
that
i
pray
you
in
your
letters
when
you
shall
these
unlucky
deeds
relate
speak
of
me
as
i
am
nothing
extenuate
nor
set
down
aught
in
malice
then
must
you
speak
of
one
that
loved
not
wisely
but
too
well
of
one
not
easily
jealous
but
being
wrought
perplexd
in
the
extreme
of
one
whose
hand
like
the
base
indian
threw
a
pearl
away
richer
than
all
his
tribe
of
one
whose
subdued
eyes
albeit
unused
to
the
melting
mood
drop
tears
as
fast
as
the
arabian
trees
their
medicinal
gum
set
you
down
this
and
say
besides
that
in
aleppo
once
where
a
malignant
and
a
turband
turk
beat
a
venetian
and
traduced
the
state
i
took
by
the
throat
the
circumcised
dog
and
smote
him
thus






























stabs
himself
lodovico
o
bloody
period
gratiano

















all
thats
spoke
is
marrd
othello
i
kissd
thee
ere
i
killd
thee
no
way
but
this
killing
myself
to
die
upon
a
kiss
falls
on
the
bed
and
dies
cassio
this
did
i
fear
but
thought
he
had
no
weapon
for
he
was
great
of
heart
lodovico








to
iago
o
spartan
dog
more
fell
than
anguish
hunger
or
the
sea
look
on
the
tragic
loading
of
this

house
and

upon
the
fortunes

they

on
you
to
you

the
censure
of
this
hellish
villain
the
time

in

thou
art
a
traitor
and
a
miscreant
too
good

so
and
too
bad

live
since
the
more
fair

the
uglier

my
cold
words

tis
not
the
trial
of
a
womans
war
the
bitter
clamour
of
two
eager
tongues
can
arbitrate
this
cause
betwixt
us
twain
the
blood
is
hot
that
must
be
coold
for
this
yet
can
i
not
of
such
tame
patience
boast
as
to
be
hushd
and
nought
at
an
to
say
first
the
fair
reverence
of
your
highness
curbs
me
from
giving
reins
and
spurs
to
my
free
speech
which
else
would
post
until
it
had
returnd
these
terms
of
treason
doubled
down
his
throat
setting
aside
his
high
bloods
royalty
and
let
him
be
no
kinsman
to
my
liege
i
do
defy
him
and
i
spit
at
him
call
him
a
slanderous
coward
and
a
villain
which
to
maintain
i
would
allow
him
odds
and
meet
him
were
i
tied
to
run
afoot
even
to
the
frozen
ridges
of
the
alps
or
any
other
ground
inhabitable
where
ever
englishman
durst
set
his
foot
meantime
let
this
defend
my
loyalty
by
all
my
hopes
most
falsely
doth
he
lie
bolingbroke
pale
trembling
coward
there
i
throw
my
gage
disclaiming
here
the
kindred
of
the
king
and
lay
aside
my
high
bloods
royalty
which
fear
not
reverence
makes
thee
to
except
if
guilty
dread
have
left
thee
so
much
strength
as
to
take
up
mine
honours
pawn
then
stoop
by
that
and
all
the
rites
of
knighthood
else
will
i
make
good
against
thee
arm
to
arm
what
i
have
spoke
or
thou
canst
worst
devise
mowbray
i
take
it
up
and
by
that
sword
i
swear
which
gently
laid
my
knighthood
on
my
shoulder
ill
answer
thee
in
any
fair
degree
or
chivalrous
design
of
knightly
trial
and
when
i
mount
alive
may
i
not
light
if
i
be
traitor
or
unjustly
fight
king
richard
what
doth
our
cousin
lay
to
mowbrays
charge
it
must
be
great
that
can
inherit
us
so
much
as
of
a
thought
of
ill
in
him
bolingbroke
look
what
i
speak
my
life
shall
prove
it
true
that
mowbray
hath
receivd
eight
thousand
nobles
in
name
of
lendings
for
your
highness
soldiers
the
which
he
hath
detaind
for
lewd
employments
like
a
false
traitor
and
injurious
villain
besides
i
say
and
will
in
battle
prove
or
here
or
elsewhere
to
the
furthest
verge
that
ever
was
surveyd
by
english
eye
that
all
the
treasons
for
these
eighteen
years
complotted
and
contrived
in
this
land
fetch
from
false
mowbray
their
first
head
and
spring
further
i
say
and
further
will
maintain
upon
his
bad
life
to
make
all
this
good
that
he
did
plot
the
duke
of
gloucesters
death
suggest
his
soonbelieving
adversaries
and
consequently
like
a
traitor
coward
sluicd
out
his
innocent
soul
through
streams
of
blood
which
blood
like
sacrificing
abels
cries
even
from
the
tongueless
caverns
of
the
earth
to
me
for
justice
and
rough
chastisement
and
by
the
glorious
worth
of
my

this

shall
do
it
or
this

be
spent
king
richard
how
high
a

his

soars
thomas
of

what
sayst
thou
to
this
mowbray
o
let
my

turn
away
his
face
and
bid
his

a
little
while
be
deaf
till
i
have
told
this

of

how

king
richard

impartial
are

my

nay
my

but
my

son
now
by
my

i
make
a

such

nothing
privilege
him
nor
partialize
the

of

i
by

for
that
my
sovereign
liege
was

of

dear
account
since

i
went
to

to
fetch
his
queen
now
swallow
down
that
lie
for

in
that
case
for
you
my
noble
lord
of
lancaster
the
honourable
father
to
my
foe
once
did
i
lay

think
the

pride
of

with
rivalhating
envy
set
on

our
peace
which
in

paths
of

shall
point
on

norfolk
for
thee
remains
a
heavier
doom
which
i
with
some
unwillingness
pronounce
the
sly
slow
hours
shall
not
determinate
the
dateless
limit
of
thy
dear
exile
the
hopeless
word
of
never

breathe
i
against

upon

mowbray
a
heavy
sentence
my
most
sovereign
liege

mouth
a

merit
not
so
deep
a
maim
as
to

forth
in

common
air
have
i
deserved
at
your
highness
hands
the
language
i
have
learnt
these
forty
years
my
native
english
now
i
must
forgo
and
now
my
tongues
use
is
to
me
no
more
than
an
unstringed
viol
or
a
harp
or
like
a
cunning
instrument
casd
up
or
being
open
put
into
his
hands
that
knows
no
touch
to
tune
the
harmony
within
my
mouth
you
have
engaold
my
tongue
doubly
portcullisd
with
my
teeth
and
lips
and
dull
unfeeling
barren
ignorance
is
made
my
gaoler
to
attend
on
me
i
am
too
old
to
fawn
upon
a
nurse
too
far
in
years
to
be
a
pupil
now
what
is
thy
sentence
then
but
speechless
death
which
robs
my

from

native
breath
king

boots
thee
not
to
be
compassionate
after

four
lagging
winters
and
four
wanton
springs
end
in
a
word
such
is
the
breath
of
kings
gaunt
i
thank
my
liege
that
in
regard
of
me
he
shortens
four
years
of
my
sons
exile
but
little
vantage
shall
i
reap
thereby
for
ere
the
six
years
that
he
hath
to
spend
can
change
their
moons
and
bring
their
times
about
my
oildried
lamp
and
timebewasted
light
shall
be
extinct
with
age
and
endless
night
my
inch
of
taper
will
be
burnt
and
done
and
blindfold
death
not
let
me
see
my
son

thou
hast
many
years
to

gaunt
but
not
a

thou
canst
give
shorten
my
days
thou
canst
with
sullen
sorrow
and
pluck
nights
from
me
but
not
lend
a
morrow
thou
canst
help
time
to
furrow
me
with
age
but
stop
no
wrinkle
in
his
pilgrimage
thy
word
is
current
with
him
for
my
death
but
dead
thy
kingdom
cannot
buy
my
breath
king
richard
thy
son
is
banishd
upon
good
advice

thou
then
to
lour
gaunt
things
sweet
to

prove
in

sour
you
urgd
me
as
a
judge
but
i
had
rather
you
would
have
bid
me
argue
like
a
father
o
had
it
been
a
stranger
not
my
child
to
smooth
his
fault
i
should
have
been
more
mild
a
partial
slander
sought
i
to
avoid
and
in
the
sentence
my
own
life
destroyd
alas
i
lookd
when
some
of
you
should
say
i
was
too
strict
to
make
mine
own
away
but
you
gave
leave
to
my
unwilling
tongue
against
my
will
to
do
myself
this
wrong
king
richard
cousin
farewell
and
uncle
bid
him
so
six
years
we
banish
him
and
he
shall
go

farewell
what

from
where
you

marshal
my
lord
no
leave
take
i
for
i
will
ride
as
far
as

let
me
by
your
side
gaunt
o
to
what
purpose
dost
thou
hoard
thy
words
that
thou
returnest
no
greeting
to
thy
friends
bolingbroke
i
have
too
few
to
take
my
leave
of
you
when
the
tongues
office
should
be
prodigal
to
breathe
the
abundant
dolour
of
the
heart
gaunt
thy
grief
is
but
thy
absence
for
a
time
bolingbroke
joy
absent
grief
is
present
for
that
time
gaunt
what
is
six
winters
they
are
quickly
gone
bolingbroke
to
men
in
joy
but
grief
makes
one
hour
ten
gaunt
call
it
a
travel
that
thou
takst
for
pleasure
bolingbroke
my
heart
will
sigh
when
i
miscall
it
so
which
finds
it
an
enforced
pilgrimage
gaunt
the
sullen
passage
of
thy
weary
steps
esteem
as
foil
wherein
thou
art
to
set
the
precious
jewel
of
thy
home
return
bolingbroke
nay
rather
every
tedious
stride
i
make

but
remember
me
what
a
deal
of
world
i
wander
from
the
jewels
that
i
love
must
i
not
serve
a
long
apprenticehood
to
foreign
passages
and
in
the
end
having
my
freedom
boast
of
nothing
else
but
that
i
was
a
journeyman
to
grief
gaunt
all
places
that
the
eye
of
heaven
visits
are
to
a
wise
man
ports
and
happy
havens
teach
thy
necessity
to
reason
thus
there
is
no
virtue
like
necessity
think
not
the
king
did
banish
thee
but
thou
the
king
woe
doth
the
heavier
sit
where
it
perceives
it
is

faintly

i
sent
thee
forth
to

thee

suppose
devouring
pestilence
hangs
in
our
air
and
thou
art
flying
to
a
fresher
clime
look
what
thy
soul
holds
dear
imagine
it
to
lie
that
way
thou
goest
not
whence
thou
comst
suppose
the
singing
birds
musicians
the
grass
whereon
thou
treadst
the
presence
strewd
the
flowers
fair
ladies
and
thy
steps
no
more
than
a
delightful
measure
or
a
dance
for
gnarling
sorrow
hath
less
power
to
bite
the
man
that
mocks
at
it
and

to
stain
the

thus
long

we
stood
to

the
fearful
bending

because
we
thought
ourself
thy

if

to

though

all
as
you

have
torn
their

by

them
from
us

we

duchess
my

weeping
made
you
break
the
story
off
of
our
two
cousins
coming
into
london
york
where
did
i
leave
duchess
at
that
sad
stop
my
lord
where
rude
misgoverned
hands
from
windows
tops
threw
dust
and
rubbish
on
king
richards
head
york
then
as
i
said
the
duke
great
bolingbroke
mounted
upon
a
hot
and
fiery
steed
which
his
aspiring
rider
seemd
to
know
with
slow
but
stately
pace
kept
on
his
course
whilst
all
tongues
cried
god
save
thee
bolingbroke
you
would
have
thought
the
very
windows
spake
so
many
greedy
looks
of
young
and
old
through
casements
darted
their
desiring
eyes
upon
his
visage
and
that
all
the
walls
with
painted
imagery
had
said
at
once
jesu
preserve
thee
welcome
bolingbroke
whilst
he
from
the
one
side
to
the
other
turning
bareheaded
lower
than
his
proud
steeds

bespake
them
thus
i

you

thus
still

thus
he
passd
along

the
eyes
of
men
after
a
wellgracd
actor
leaves
the

are
idly
bent
on
him
that

thinking
his
prattle
to
be
tedious
even
so
or
with
much
more
contempt
mens
eyes
did
scowl
on
gentle
richard
no
man
cried
god
save
him
no
joyful
tongue
gave
him
his
welcome
home
but
dust
was
thrown
upon
his
sacred
head
which
with
such
gentle
sorrow
he
shook
off
his
face
still
combating
with
tears
and
smiles
the
badges
of
his
grief
and
patience
that
had
not
god
for
some
strong
purpose
steeld
the
hearts
of
men
they
must
perforce
have
melted
and
barbarism
itself
have
pitied
him

as

king
richard
i
have
been
studying
how
i
may
compare
this
prison
where
i
live
unto
the
world
and
for
because
the
world
is
populous
and
here
is
not
a
creature
but
myself
i
cannot
do
it
yet
ill
hammer
it
out
my
brain
ill
prove
the
female
to
my
soul
my
soul
the
father
and
these
two
beget
a
generation
of
stillbreeding
thoughts
and
these
same
thoughts
people
this
little
world
in
humours
like
the
people
of
this
world
for
no
thought
is
contented
the
better
sort
as
thoughts
of
things
divine
are
intermixd
with
scruples
and
do
set
the
word
itself
against
the
word
as
thus
come
little
ones
and
then
again
it
is
as
hard
to
come
as
for
a
camel
to
thread
the
postern
of
a
small
needles
eye
thoughts
tending
to
ambition
they
do
plot
unlikely
wonders
how
these
vain
weak
nails
may
tear
a
passage
through
the
flinty
ribs
of
this
hard
world
my
ragged
prison
walls
and
for
they
cannot
die
in
their
own
pride
thoughts
tending
to
content
flatter
themselves
that
they
are
not
the
first
of
fortunes
slaves
nor
shall
not
be
the
last
like
silly
beggars
who
sitting
in
the
stocks
refuge
their
shame
that
many
have
and
others
must
sit
there
and
in
this
thought
they
find
a
kind
of
ease
bearing
their
own
misfortunes
on
the
back
of
such
as
have
before
endurd
the
like
thus
play
i
in
one
person
many
people
and
none
contented
sometimes
am
i
king
then
treasons
make
me
wish
myself
a
beggar
and
so
i
am
then
crushing
penury
persuades
me
i
was
better
when
a

then
am
i
kingd
again
and
by

that
i

instead

the

nimbly
in

so
lamely

therefore
since
i
cannot
prove

i
am
determined
to
prove
a
villain
and
hate
the
idle
pleasures
of
these

plots
have
i
laid
inductions
dangerous
by

prophecies
libels

to
set
my

and
the

in
deadly
hate
the

against
the

and
if
king
edward
be
as
true
and
just
as
i
am
subtle
false
and
treacherous
this
day
should
clarence
closely
be
mewd
up
about
a
prophecy
which
says
that
g
of

heirs
the

down

tendring
my
persons
safety
hath
appointed
this
conduct
to
convey
me
to

gloucester
upon
what
cause

i
know
clarence
yea
richard
when
i
know
for
i
protest
as
yet
i
do
not
but
as
i
can
learn
he
hearkens
after
prophecies
and
dreams
and
from
the
crossrow
plucks
the
letter
g
and
says
a
wizard
told
him
that
by
g
his
issue
disinherited
should
be

for
my
name
of
george
begins
with

follows
in
his
thought
that

am
he

as
i
learn
and
such
like
toys
as
these
hath
movd
his
highness
to

lady

she
that

betwixt
the

what
an
humble
suppliant

my
lord
chamberlain
his
liberty
ill
tell
you
whati
think
it
is
our
way
if
we
will
keep

favour
with
the
king
to
be
her
men
and
wear
her
livery
the
jealous
oerworn
widow
and

since
that
our

them
gentlewomen
are
mighty
gossips
in
our
monarchy
brakenbury
i
beseech
your
graces
both
to
pardon
me
his

have
private
conference
of
what
degree
soever
with
your

so
ant
please

you
may
partake
of
any
thing
we

say
the
king
is
wise
and
virtuous
and
his
noble
queen
well
struck
in
years
fair
and
not
jealous
we
say
that
shores
wife
hath
a
pretty
foot
a
cherry
lip
a
bonny
eye
a
passing
pleasing
tongue
and
that
the
queens
kindred
are
made
gentlefolks
how
say
you
sir
can
you
deny
all
this
brakenbury
with
this
my
lord

have
naught
to
do
gloucester
naught

though

the
which

inot
all
so

for

blameful
as
the
executioner
anne
thou

the
cause
of
that
effect
your

when
my

the
piteous
moan
that
rutland
made

prompts
my
tongue
to
speak

looks
scornfully
at
him
teach
not
thy
lip
such
scorn
for
it
was
made
for
kissing

contempt

sharppointed
sword

it
naked
to
the
deadly
stroke
and

my
knee

her
in
her

extremest
hate
with
curses
in
her
mouth

the
bleeding
witness
of
my
hatred
by

her
conscience
and
these
bars
against
me

am
crept
in

with

will
maintain
it
with
some
little

ill
turn
yon
fellow
in
his

and
then
return
lamenting
to

keeper
why
looks
your
grace
so
heavily
today
clarence
o
i
have
passd
a
miserable
night
so
full
of
fearful
dreams
of
ugly
sights
that
as
i
am
a
christian
faithful
man
i
would
not
spend
another
such
a
night
though
twere
to
buy
a
world
of
happy
days
so
full
of
dismal
terror
was
the
time
keeper
what
was
your
dream
my
lord
i
pray
you
tell
me
clarence
methoughts
that
i
had
broken
from
the
tower
and
was
embarkd
to
cross
to
burgundy
and
in
my
company
my
brother
gloucester
who
from
my
cabin
tempted
me
to
walk
upon
the
hatches
thence
we
lookd
toward
england
and
cited
up
a
thousand
heavy
times
during
the
wars
of
york
and
lancaster
that
had
befalln
us
as
we
pacd
along
upon
the
giddy
footing
of
the
hatches
methought
that
gloucester
stumbled
and
in
falling
struck
me
that
thought
to
stay
him
overboard
into
the
tumbling
billows
of
the
main
o
lord
methought
what
pain
it
was
to
drown
what
dreadful
noise
of
waters
in
my
ears
what
sights
of
ugly
death
within
my
eyes
methoughts
i
saw
a
thousand
fearful
wrecks
a
thousand
men
that
fishes
gnawd
upon
wedges
of
gold
great
anchors
heaps
of
pearl
inestimable
stones
unvalued
jewels
all
scattred
in
the
bottom
of
the
sea
some
lay
in
dead
mens
skulls
and
in
the
holes
where
eyes
did
once
inhabit
there
were
crept
as
twere
in
scorn
of
eyes
reflecting
gems
that
wood
the
slimy
bottom
of
the
deep
and
mockd
the
dead
bones
that
lay
scattred
by
keeper
had
you
such
leisure
in
the
time
of
death
to
gaze
upon
these
secrets
of
the
deep
clarence
methought
i
had
and
often
did
i
strive
to
yield
the
ghost
but
still
the
envious
flood
stoppd
in
my
soul
and
would
not
let
it
forth
to
find
the
empty
vast
and
wandring
air
but
smotherd
it
within
my
panting
bulk
who
almost
burst
to
belch
it
in
the

keeper
awakd
you
not
in
this
sore
agony
clarence
no
no
my
dream
was
lengthend
after

o
then
began
the
tempest
to
my
soul
i
passd
methought
the
melancholy
flood
with
that
sour
ferryman
which
poets
write
of
unto
the
kingdom
of
perpetual
night
the
first
that
there
did
greet
my
stranger

my
great
fatherinlaw
renowned
warwick
who
spake
aloud
what
scourge
for
perjury
can
this
dark
monarchy
afford
false
clarence
and
so
he
vanishd
then
came
wandring
by
a
shadow
like
an
angel
with
bright
hair
dabbled
in
blood
and
he
shriekd
out
aloud

the

why
with
some
little

my
lord
of
buckingham
buckingham
marry
my
lord
lest
by
a
multitude
the
newheald
wound
of
malice
should
break
out
which
would
be
so
much
the
more
dangerous
by
how
much
the
estate
is
green
and
yet
ungovernd
where
every
horse
bears
his
commanding
rein
and
may
direct
his
course
as
please
himself
as
well
the
fear
of
harm
as
harm
apparent
in
my
opinion
ought
to
be
prevented
gloucester
i
hope
the
king
made
peace
with
all
of
us
and
the
compact
is
firm
and
true
in
me
rivers
and
so
in
me
and
so
i
think
in
an
yet
since
it
is
but
green
it
should
be
put
to
no
apparent
likelihood
of
breach
which
haply
by
much
company
might
be
urgd
therefore
i
say
with
noble
buckingham
that
it
is
meet
so
few
should
fetch
the
prince
hastings
and
so
say
i
gloucester
then
be
it
so
and
go
we
to
determine
who
they
shall
be
that
straight
shall
post

the

your

the

would
fain
have
come

me
to

but
by
his

was
perforce
withheld
buckingham
fie
what
an
indirect
and
peevish
course
is
this
of
hers
lord
cardinal
will
your

persuade
the
queen
to
send
the
duke
of
york
unto
his
princely
brother
presently
if
she
deny
lord
hastings
go
with
him
and
from
her
jealous
arms
pluck
him
perforce
cardinal
my
lord
of
buckingham
if
my
weak
oratory
can
from
his
mother
win
the
duke
of
york
anon
expect
him
here
but
if
she
be
obdurate
to
mild
entreaties
god
in
heaven
forbid
we
should
infringe
the
holy
privilege
of
blessed
sanctuary
not
for
all
this
land
would
i
be
guilty
of
so
deep
a
sin
buckingham
you
are
too
senselessobstinate
my
lord
too
ceremonious
and
traditional
weigh
it
but
with
the
grossness
of
this
age
you
break
not
sanctuary
in
seizing
him
the
benefit
thereof
is
always
granted
to
those
whose
dealings
have
deservd
the
place
and
those
who
have
the
wit
to
claim
the
place
this
prince
hath
neither
claimd
it
nor
deservd
it
and
therefore
in
mine
opinion
cannot
have
it
then
taking
him
from
thence
that
is
not
there
you
break
no
privilege
nor
charter
there
oft
have
i
heard
of

never

we
sojourn
till
our
coronation
gloucester
where

best
unto
your
royal
self
if

may
counsel
you
some
day
or
two
your
highness

repose
you
at
the

health
and
recreation
prince
i
do
not
like
the
tower
of
any
place
did
julius
caesar
build
that
place
my
lord
buckingham
he
did
my
gracious
lord
begin
that
place
which
since
succeeding
ages
have
reedified
prince
is
it
upon
record
or
else
reported
successively
from
age
to
age
he
built
it
buckingham
upon
record
my
gracious
lord
prince
but
say
my
lord
it
were
not
registred
methinks
the
truth
should

from
age
to
age
as
twere
retaild
to
all
posterity
even
to
the

allending
day

young
they
say
do
never
live
long
prince
what
say
you
uncle
gloucester

say
without
characters
fame
lives
long
aside

thus
like
the
formal
vice
iniquity
i
moralize
two
meanings
in
one
word
prince
that
julius
caesar
was
a
famous
man
with
what
his
valour
did
enrich
his
wit
his
wit
set
down
to
make
his
valour
live
death
makes
no
conquest
of
this
conqueror
for
now
he
lives
in
fame
though
not
in
life
ill
tell
you
what
my
cousin
buckingham

if
i
live
until

fair
cousin
i
must

being
but
a
toy
which
is
no
grief
to

greater
gift
than

give
my
cousin
york
a
greater
gift

thats
the
sword
to
it
gloucester
