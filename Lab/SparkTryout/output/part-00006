on
his
knees
at
meditation
not
dallying
with
a
brace
of
courtezans
but
meditating
with
two
deep
divines
not
sleeping
to
engross
his
idle
body
but
praying
to
enrich
his
watchful
soul
happy
were

thereof
before

fears
my

props
of
virtue
for
a
christian

to

fall
of
vanity
and
see
a
book
of

in
his

true
ornaments
to

famous

even
that
i
hope
which
pleaseth
god
above
and
all
good
men
of
this
ungovernd
isle
gloucester
i
do
suspect
i
have
done
some
offence
that
seems
disgracious
in
the
citys
eye
and
that
you
come
to
reprehend
my
ignorance
buckingham
you
have
my
lord
would
it
might
please
your
grace
on
our
entreaties
to
amend
your
fault
gloucester
else
wherefore
breathe
i
in
a
christian
land
buckingham
know
then
it
is
your
fault
that
you
resign
the
supreme
seat
the
throne
majestical
the
sceptred
office
of
your
ancestors
your
state
of
fortune
and
your
due
of
birth
the
lineal
glory
of
your
royal
house
to
the
corruption
of
a
blemishd
stock
whiles
in
the
mildness
of
your
sleepy
thoughts
which
here
we
waken
to
our
countrys
good
the
noble
isle
doth
want
her
proper
limbs
her
face
defacd
with
scars
of
infamy
her
royal
stock
graft
with
ignoble
plants
and
almost
shouldred
in
the
swallowing
gulf
of
dark
forgetfulness
and
deep
oblivion
which
to
recure
we
heartily
solicit
your
gracious
self
to
take
on
you
the
charge
and
kingly
government
of
this
your
land
not
as
protector
steward
substitute
or
lowly
factor
for
anothers
gain
but
as
successively
from
blood
to
blood
your
right
of
birth
your
empery
your
own
for
this
consorted
with
the
citizens
your
very
worshipful
and
loving
friends
and
by
their
vehement
instigation
in
this
just
cause
come
i
to
move
your
grace
gloucester
i
cannot
tell
if
to
depart
in
silence
or
bitterly
to
speak
in
your
reproof
best
fitteth
my
degree
or
your
condition
if
not
to
answer
you
might
haply
think
tonguetied
ambition
not
replying
yielded
to
bear
the
golden
yoke
of
sovereignty
which
fondly
you
would
here
impose
on
me
if
to
reprove
you
for
this
suit
of
yours
so
seasond
with
your
faithful
love
to
me
then
on
the
other
side
i
checkd
my
friends
thereforeto
speak
and
to
avoid
the
first
and
then
in
speaking
not
to
incur
the
last
definitively
thus
i
answer
you
your
love
deserves
my
thanks
but
my
desert
unmeritable
shuns
your
high
request
first
if
all
obstacles
were
cut
away
and
that
my
path
were
even
to
the
crown
as
the
ripe
revenue
and
due
of
birth
yet
so
much
is
my
poverty
of
spirit
so
mighty
and
so
many
my
defects
that
i
would
rather
hide
me
from
my
greatness
being
a
bark
to
brook
no
mighty
sea
than
in
my
greatness
covet
to
be
hid
and
in
the
vapour
of
my
glory
smotherd
but
god
be
thankd
there
is
no
need
of
me
and
much
i
need
to
help
you
were
there
need
the
royal
tree
hath
left
us
royal
fruit
which
mellowd
by
the
stealing
hours
of
time
will
well
become
the
seat
of
majesty
and
make
no
doubt
us
happy
by
his
reign
on
him
i
lay
that
you
would
lay
on
me
the
right
and
fortune
of
his
happy
stars
which
god
defend
that
i
should
wring
from
him
buckingham
my
lord
this
argues
conscience
in
your
grace
but
the
respects
thereof
are
nice
and
trivial
all
circumstances
well
considered
you
say
that
edward
is
your
brothers
son
so
say
we
too
but
not
by
edwards
wife
for
first
was
he
contract
to
lady
lucy
your
mother
lives
a
witness
to
his
vow
and
afterward
by
substitute
betrothd
to
bona
sister
to
the
king
of
france
these
both
put
off
a
poor
petitioner
a
carecrazd
mother
to
a
many
sons
a
beautywaning
and
distressed
widow
even
in
the
afternoon
of
her
best
days
made
prize
and
purchase
of
his
wanton
eye
seducd
the
pitch
and
height
of
his
degree
to
base
declension
and
loathd
bigamy
by
her
in
his
unlawful
bed
he
got
this
edward
whom
our
manners
call
the
prince
more
bitterly
could
i
expostulate
save
that
for
reverence
to
some
alive
i
give
a
sparing
limit
to
my
tongue
then
good
my
lord
take
to
your
royal
self
this
profferd
benefit
of
dignity
if
not
to
bless
us
and
the
land
withal
yet
to
draw
forth
your
noble
ancestry
from
the
corruption
of
abusing
times
unto
a
lineal
truederived
course
mayor
do
good
my
lord

soil
this

two

blood
makes
civil
hands
unclean

forth
the
fatal
loins
of
these
two
foes
a
pair
of
starcrossd
lovers

their
life
whose
misadventurd
piteous
overthrows
doth
with
their
death
bury
their
parents
strife
the
fearful
passage
of
their
deathmarkd
love
and
the
continuance
of
their
parents
rage
which
but
their
childrens
end
naught
could
remove
is
now
the
two
hours
traffic
of
our
stage
the
which
if
you
with
patient
ears
attend
what
here
shall
miss
our
toil
shall
strive

breathd
defiance
to

he
swung
about

him
in
scorn

golden
window

troubled

me
to
walk
abroad

underneath
the
grove
of
sycamore
that
westward
rooteth
from
the
citys
side
so
early
walking
did
i
see
your
son
towards
him
i
made
but
he
was
ware
of
me
and
stole
into
the
covert
of
the
wood
i
measuring
his
affections
by
my
own
which
then
most
sought
where
most
might
not
be
found
being
one
too
many
by
my
weary
self
pursud
my
humour
not
pursuing
his
and
gladly
shunnd
who
gladly
fled
from
me
mon
many
a
morning
hath
he
there
been
seen
with
tears
augmenting
the
fresh
mornings
dew
adding
to
clouds
more
clouds
with
his
deep
sighs
but
all
so
soon
as
the
allcheering
sun
should
in
the
farthest
east
bean
to
draw
the
shady
curtains
from
auroras
bed
away
from
light
steals
home
my
heavy
son
and
private
in
his
chamber
pens
himself
shuts
up
his
windows
locks
fair
daylight
and
makes
himself
an
artificial
night
black
and
portentous
must
this
humour
prove
unless
good
counsel
may
the
cause
remove
ben
my
noble
uncle
do
you
know
the
cause

to
himself
i
will
not
say
how
true
but
to
himself
so
secret
and
so
close
so
far
from
sounding
and
discovery
as
is
the
bud
bit
with
an
envious
worm
ere
he
can
spread
his
sweet
leaves
to
the
air
or
dedicate
his
beauty
to
the
sun
could
we
but
learn
from
whence
his
sorrows
grow

willingly
give
cure

the
airy
region
stream
so
bright
that

by
whose
direction
foundst
thou
out
this
place
rom
by

to
enquire

counsel
and
i
lent

as
far

blush
bepaint
my

that
which
thou
hast
heard

speak
tonight
fain
would
i
dwell
on

mayst
prove
false
at
lovers
perjuries
they
say
jove

if
thou
thinkest

nay
so
thou
wilt
woo

more
strange

must
confess

who
all

turns
deadly
point

with
a
martial
scorn
with

hand
beats
cold
death
aside

sends

an

thrust
from

but
call

wise
and
with
this
knife
ill
help
it
presently
god
joind
my
heart
and
romeos
thou
our
hands
and
ere

be
the
label
to
another
deed
or
my
true
heart
with
treacherous
revolt

if
what
thou

of
hope

desperate
an
execution

that
is
desperate
which
we
would
prevent
if
rather
than
to
marry
county
paris
thou
hast
the
strength
of
will
to
slay
thyself
then
is
it
likely
thou
wilt
undertake
a
thing
like
death
to
chide
away
this
shame
that
copst
with
death
himself
to
scape
from
it
and
if
thou
darst
ill
give
thee
remedy
jul
o
bid
me
leap
rather
than
marry
paris

off
the
battlements
of
yonder
tower
or
walk
in
thievish
ways
or
bid
me
lurk
where
serpents
are
chain
me
with
roaring
bears
or
shut
me
nightly
in
a
charnel
house
oercoverd
quite
with
dead
mens
rattling
bones
with
reeky
shanks
and
yellow
chapless
skulls

bid
me
go
into
a
newmade
grave
and
hide
me
with
a
dead
man
in
his
shroud
things
that
to
hear
them
told
have
made
me
tremble
and
i
will
do
it
without
fear
or
doubt
to
live
an
unstaind
wife
to
my
sweet
love
friar

thou
lie
alone

not
the
nurse
lie
with
thee
in
thy
chamber
take
thou
this
vial
being
then
in
bed
and
this
distilled
liquor
drink
thou
off
when
presently
through
all
thy
veins
shall
run
a
cold
and
drowsy
humour
for
no
pulse
shall
keep
his
native
progress
but
surcease
no
warmth
no
breath
shall
testify
thou
livest
the
roses
in
thy
lips
and
cheeks
shall
fade
to
paly
ashes
thy
eyes
windows
fall
like
death
when
he
shuts
up
the
day
of
life
each
part
deprivd
of
supple
government
shall
stiff
and
stark
and
cold
appear
like
death
and
in
this
borrowed
likeness
of
shrunk
death
thou
shalt
continue
twoandforty
hours
and
then
awake
as
from
a
pleasant
sleep
now
when
the
bridegroom
in
the
morning
comes
to
rouse
thee
from
thy
bed
there
art
thou
dead
then
as
the
manner
of
our
country
is
in
thy
best
robes
uncovered
on
the
bier
thou
shalt
be
borne
to
that
same
ancient
vault
where
all
the
kindred
of
the
capulets
lie
in
the
mean
time
against
thou
shalt
awake
shall
romeo
by
my
letters
know
our
drift
and
hither
shall
he
come
and
he
and
i
will
watch
thy
waking
and
that
very
night
shall
romeo
bear
thee
hence
to
mantua
and
this
shall
free
thee
from
this
present
shame

toy

all
in
this
so
sudden
business

rest
for
thou
hast
need
exeunt
mother
and
nurse
jul
farewell
god

when

a
faint
cold
fear

freezes

the
heat
of
life
ill
call

to
comfort
me
nurse

be
married
then
tomorrow
morning
no
no
this
shall
forbid
it
lie
thou
there
lays
down
a
dagger
what
if
it
be
a
poison
which
the
friar
subtilly
hath
ministred
to
have
me
dead
lest
in
this
marriage
he
should
be
dishonourd
because
he
married
me
before
to
romeo
i
fear
it
is
and
yet
methinks
it
should
not
for
he
hath
still
been
tried
a
holy
man
i
will
not
entertain
so
bad
a
thought
how
if
when
i
am
laid
into
the
tomb
i
wake
before
the
time
that
romeo
come
to
redeem
me
theres
a
fearful
point
shall
i
not
then
be
stifled
in
the
vault
to
whose
foul
mouth
no
healthsome
air
breathes
in
and
there
die
strangled
ere
my
romeo
comes
or
if
i
live
is
it
not
very
like
the
horrible
conceit
of
death
and
night
together
with
the
terror
of
the
place
as
in
a
vault
an
ancient
receptacle
where
for
this
many
hundred
years
the
bones
of
all
my
buried
ancestors
are
packd
where
bloody
tybalt
yet
but
green
in
earth
lies
festring
in
his
shroud
where
as
they
say
at
some
hours
in
the
night
spirits
resort
alack
alack
is
it
not
like
that
i
so
early
waking
what
with
loathsome
smells
and
shrieks
like
mandrakes
torn
out
of
the
earth
that
living
mortals
hearing
them
run
mad
o
if
i
wake
shall
i
not
be
distraught
environed
with
all
these
hideous
fears
and
madly
play
with
my
forefathers
joints
and
pluck
the
mangled
tybalt
from
his
shroud
and
in
this
rage
with
some
great
kinsmans
bone
as
with
a
club
dash
out
my
desprate
brains
o
look
methinks
i
see
my
cousins
ghost
seeking
out
romeo
that
did
spit
his
body
upon
a
rapiers
point
stay
tybalt
stay
romeo
i
come
this
do
i

to
thee

once
what
thou
dost
know
in
this
friar
i
will
be
brief
for
my
short
date
of
breath
is
not
so
long
as
is
a
tedious
tale
romeo
there
dead
was
husband
to
that
juliet
and
she
there
dead
that
romeos
faithful
wife
i
married
them
and
their
stoln
marriage
day
was
tybalts
doomsday
whose
untimely
death
banishd
the
newmade
bridegroom
from
this
city
for
whom
and
not
for
tybalt
juliet
pind
you
to
remove
that
siege
of
grief
from
her
betrothd
and
would
have
married
her
perforce
to
county
paris
then
comes
she
to
me
and
with
wild
looks
bid
me
devise
some
mean
to
rid
her
from
this
second
marriage
or
in
my
cell
there
would
she
kill
herself
then
gave
i
her
so
tutored
by
my
art
a
sleeping
potion
which
so
took
effect
as
i
intended
for
it
wrought
on
her
the
form
of
death
meantime
i
writ
to
romeo
that
he
should
hither
come
as
this
dire
night
to
help
to
take
her
from
her
borrowed
grave
being
the
time
the
potions
force
should
cease
but
he
which
bore
my
letter
friar
john
was
stayd
by
accident
and
yesternight
returnd
my
letter
back
then
all
alone
at
the
prefixed
hour
of
her
waking
came
i
to
take
her
from
her
kindreds
vault
meaning
to
keep
her
closely
at
my
cell
till
i
conveniently
could
send
to
romeo
but
when
i
came
some
minute
ere
the
time
of
her
awaking
here
untimely
lay
the
noble
paris
and
true
romeo
dead
she
wakes
and
i
entreated
her
come
forth
and
bear
this
work
of
heaven
with
patience
but
then
a
noise
did
scare
me
from
the
tomb
and
she
too
desperate
would
not
go
with
me
but
as
it
seems
did
violence
on
herself
all
this
i
know
and
to
the
marriage
her
nurse
is
privy
and
if
aught
in
this
miscarried
by
my
fault
let
my
old
life
be
sacrificd
some
hour
before
his
time

the
rigour

obeisance
tell

your

embracements
tempting

shed
tears
as
being
overjoyed
to

lord
restord

loathsome
beggar

not
a
womans
gift
to

a
shower
of

tears
an

is
faults
enough
is
that
she
is
intolerable
curst
and
shrewd
and
froward
so
beyond
all
measure
that
were
my
state
far
worser
than
it
is
i
would
not
wed
her
for
a
mine
of
gold
petruchio
hortensio

knowst
not
golds

tis
enough
for
i

chide
as
loud
as
thunder
when
the
clouds
in
autumn
crack
hortensio
her
father
is
baptista
minola
an
affable
and
courteous
gentleman
her
name
is
katherina
minola
renownd
in
padua
for
her
scolding
tongue
petruchio

he
knew
my
deceased
father
well

humour
lasts
o
my
word
and
she
knew
him
as
well
as
i
do
she
would
think
scolding
would
do
little
good
upon
him
she
may
perhaps
call
him
half
a

a
little
he

with
it
that
she
shall
have
no
more
eyes
to

i
see
no
reason
but
supposd
lucentio
must
get
a
father
calld
supposd
vincentio
and
thats
a
wonder
fathers
commonly
do
get
their
children
but
in
this
case
of
wooing
a
child
shall
get
a
sire
if
i
fail
not
of
my
cunning
exit

that

should
be
married
and
yet
we
hear
not
of

what

said
what
mockery
will
it
be
to
want
the
bridegroom
when
the

attends
to
speak
the
ceremonial
rites
of
marriage
what
says
lucentio
to
this
shame
of
ours
katherina
no
shame
but
mine
i
must
forsooth
be
forcd
to
give
my

unto
a
madbrain
rudesby
full
of
spleen
who
wood
in

and
means
to
wed
at
leisure
i
told
you
i
he
was
a
frantic
fool
hiding
his
bitter
jests
in
blunt
behaviour
and
to
be
noted
for
a
merry
man
hell
woo
a
thousand
point
the
day
of
marriage
make
friends
invited
and
proclaim
the
banns
yet
never
means
to
wed
where
he
hath
wood
now
must
the
world
point
at
poor
katherine

say
lo
there
is
mad
petruchios
wife
if
it
would
please
him
come

cannot
blame

title
with
a
lovely

exeunt
petruchio
and
petruchio
tranio
he
hath
some
meaning

baptista
ill
after
him
and
see
the
event

book
and
as
he
stoopd
again
to
take
it
up
this
madbraind
bridegroom

such
a
cuff
that

the
vicar
meant
to
cozen
him
but
after

ceremonies
done
he
calls
for

health
quoth
he
as
if
he
had
been
abroad
carousing
to
his
mates
after
a
storm
quaffd
off
the
muscadel
and
threw
the
sops
all
in
the
sextons
face
having
no
other
reason
but
that
his
beard
grew
thin
and
hungerly
and
seemd
to
ask
him
sops
as
he
was
drinking
this
done
he
took
the
bride
about
the
neck
and
kissd
her
lips
with
such
a
clamorous
smack
that
at
the
parting
all
the
church
did
echo
and
i
seeing
this
came
thence
for
very
shame
and
after

duty
call
you
this
lucentio
i
would
your

were
as
foolish
too
the
wisdom
of
your

fair
bianca
hath
cost

a
hundred

since

bianca
the
more
fool
you
for
laying
on
my
duty
petruchio
katherine
i
charge
thee
tell
these
headstrong
women
what
duty
they
do
owe
their
lords
and
husbands
widow
come
come
youre
mocking
we
will
have
no
telling
petruchio
come
on
i
say
and
first
begin
with
her
widow
she
shall
not
petruchio
i
say
she
shall
and
first
begin
with
her
katherina
fie
fie
unknit
that
threatening
unkind
brow
and
dart
not
scornful
glances
from
those
eyes
to
wound
thy
lord
thy
king
thy
governor
it
blots
thy
beauty
as
frosts
do
bite
the
meads
confounds
thy
fame
as
whirlwinds
shake
fair
buds
and
in
no
sense
is
meet
or
amiable
a
woman
movd
is
like
a
fountain
troubled
muddy
illseeming
thick
bereft
of
beauty
and
while
it
is
so
none
so
dry
or
thirsty
will
deign
to
sip
or
touch
one
drop
of
it
thy
husband
is
thy
lord
thy
life
thy
keeper
thy
head
thy
sovereign
one
that
cares
for
thee
and
for
thy
maintenance
commits
his
body
to
painful
labour
both
by
sea
and
land
to
watch
the
night
in
storms
the
day
in
cold
whilst
thou
liest
warm
at
home
secure
and
safe
and
craves
no
other
tribute
at
thy
hands
but
love
fair
looks
and
true
obedience
too
little
payment
for
so
great
a
debt
such
duty
as
the
subject
owes
the
prince
even
such
a
woman
oweth
to
her
husband
and
when
she
is
froward
peevish
sullen
sour
and
not
obedient
to
his
honest
will
what
is
she
but
a
foul
contending
rebel
and
graceless
traitor
to
her
loving
lord
i
am
ashamd
that
women
are
so
simple
to
offer
war
where
they
should
kneel
for
peace
or
seek
for
rule
supremacy
and
sway
when
they
are
bound
to
serve
love
and
obey
why
are
our
bodies
soft
and
weak
and
smooth
unapt
to
toll
and
trouble
in
the
world
but
that
our
soft
conditions
and
our
hearts
should
well
agree
with
our
external
parts
come
come
you
froward
and
unable
worms
my
mind
hath
been
as
big
as
one
of
yours
my
heart
as
great
my
reason
haply
more
to
bandy
word
for
word
and
frown
for
frown
but
now
i
see
our
lances
are
but
straws
our
strength
as
weak
our
weakness
past
compare
that
seeming
to
be
most
which
we
indeed
least
are
then
vail
your
stomachs
for
it
is
no
boot
and
place
your
hands
below
your
husbands
foot
in
token
of
which
duty
if
he
please
my
hand
is
ready
may
it
do
him
ease
petruchio
why
theres
a
wench
come
on
and
kiss
me
kate
lucentio
well
go
thy
ways
old
lad
for
thou
shalt
hat
vincentio
tis
a
good
hearing
when

harsh
hearing

froward

come
kate

to

direful
spectacle

which
touchd
the
very
virtue
of
compassion
in
thee
i
have
with
such
provision
in
mine
art
so
safely
ordered
that
there

no
soul
no
not
so
much
perdition
as
an
hair
betid
to
any
creature
in
the
vessel
which
thou

cry
which
thou
sawst
sink

down
for

must
now
know

often
begun

tell
me
what

bootless
inquisition

me
that
hath
kept
with
thy
remembrance
miranda
tis
far
off

rather
like
a
dream
than
an
assurance
that
my
remembrance
warrants
had
i
not
four
or
five
women
once
that
tended
me
prospero
thou
hadst
and
more
miranda
but
how
is
it
that
this
lives
in
thy

dark
backward
and
abysm
of

remembrest
aught
ere

and
that
you

some
good
instruction

request
which
i
do

pronounce
is
o
you
wonder
if
you

single
thing

wonders
to
hear
thee

does
hear
me
and
that
he
does
i
weep
myself

beheld
the
king
my
father

in
their
infancy

all
bound
up
my

loss
the
weakness

the

we
all
of
joy
for
our
escape

much
beyond
our
loss
our
hint
of
woe
is
common
every
day
some
sailors
wife
the
masters
of
some
merchant
and
the
merchant
have
just
our
theme
of
woe
but
for
the
miracle
i
mean
our
preservation
few
in
millions
can
speak
like
us
then
wisely
good
sir
weigh
our
sorrow
with
our
comfort
alonso
prithee
peace
sebastian
he
receives
comfort
like
cold
porridge
antonio
the
visitor
will
not
give
him
oer
so
sebastian
look
hes
winding
up
the
watch
of
his
wit
by
and
by
it
will
strike
gonzalo
sir
sebastian
onetell
gonzalo
when
every
grief
is
entertaind
thats
offerd
comes
to
th
entertainer
sebastian
a
dollar
gonzalo
dolour
comes
to
him
indeed
you
have
spoken
truer
than
you
purposd
sebastian
you
have
taken
it
wiselier
than
i
meant
you
should
gonzalo
therefore
my
lord
antonio
fie
what
a
spendthrift
is
he
of
his
tongue
alonso
i
prithee
spare
gonzalo
well
i
have
done
but
yet
sebastian
he
will
be
talking
antonio
which
of
he
or
adrian
for
a
good
wager
first
begins
to
crow

a
laughter
sebastian
a
match
adrian
though
this
island
seem
to
be
desert
antonio
ha
ha
ha
sebastian
so
youre
paid
adrian
uninhabitable
and
almost
inaccessible
sebastian
yet
adrian
yet
antonio
he
could
not
misst
adrian
it
must
needs
be
of
subtle
tender
and
delicate
temperance
antonio
temperance
was
a
delicate
wench
sebastian
ay
and
a
subtle
as
he
most
learnedly
deliverd
adrian
the
air
breathes
upon
us
here
most
sweetly
sebastian
as
if
it
had
lungs
and
rotten
ones
antonio
or
as
twere
perfumd
by
a
fen
gonzalo
here
is
everything
advantageous
to
life
antonio
true
save
means
to
live
sebastian
of
that
theres
none
or
little
gonzalo
how
lush
and
lusty
the
grass
looks
how
green
antonio
the
ground
indeed
is
tawny
sebastian
with
an
eye
of
green
int
antonio
he
misses
not
much
sebastian
no
he
doth
but
mistake
the
truth
totally
gonzalo
but
the
rarity
of
it
is
which
is
indeed
almost
beyond
credit
sebastian
as
many
vouchd
rarities
are
gonzalo
that
our
garments
being
as
they
were
drenchd
in
the
sea
hold
notwithstanding
their
freshness
and
glosses
being
rather
newdyd
than
staind
with
salt
water
antonio
if
but
one
of
his
pockets
could
speak
would
it
not
say
he
lies
sebastian
ay
or
very
falsely
pocket
up
his
report
gonzalo
methinks
our
garments
are
now
as
fresh
as
when
we
put
them
on
first
in
afric
at
the
marriage
of
the
kings
fair
daughter
claribel
to
the
king
of
tunis
sebastian
twas
a
sweet
marriage
and
we
prosper
well
in
our
return
adrian
tunis
was
never
gracd
before
with
such
a
paragon
to
their
queen
gonzalo
not
since
widow
didos
time
antonio
widow
a
pox
o
that
how
came
that
widow
in
widow
dido
sebastian
what
if
he
had
said
widower
aeneas
too
good
lord
how
you
take
it
adrian
widow
dido
said
you
you
make
me
study
of
that

gonzalo
this
tunis
sir
was
carthage
adrian
carthage
gonzalo
i
assure
you
carthage
antonio
his
word
is
more
than
the
miraculous
harp
sebastian
he
hath
raisd
the
wall
and
houses
too
antonio
what
impossible
matter
will
he
make
easy
next
sebastian
i
think
he
will
carry
this
island
home
in
his
pocket
and
give
it
his
son
for
an
apple
antonio
and
sowing
the
kernels
of
it
in
the
sea
bring
forth
more
islands
gonzalo
ay
antonio
why
in
good
time
gonzalo
sir
we
were
talking
that
our
garments
seem
now
as
fresh
as
when
we
were
at
tunis
at
the
marriage
of
your
daughter
who
is
now
queen
antonio
and
the
rarest
that
eer
came
there
sebastian
bate
i
beseech
you
widow
dido
antonio
o
widow
dido
ay
widow
dido
gonzalo
is
not
sir

doublet
as
fresh
as
the
first
day
i
wore
it
i
mean
in
a
sort
antonio
that
sort
was
well
fishd
for
gonzalo
when
i
wore
it
at
your
daughters
marriage
alonso
you
cram
these
words
into
mine
ears
against
the
stomach
of
my
sense
would
i
had
never
married
my
daughter
there
for
coming
thence
my
son
is
lost
and
in
my
rate
she
too
who

so
far
from
italy
removed
i
neer
again

see
her
o
thou
mine
heir
of
naples
and
of
milan
what
strange
fish
hath
made
his
meal
on
thee
francisco
sir
he
may
live
i
saw
him
beat
the
surges
under
him
and
ride
upon
their
backs
he
trod
the
water
whose
enmity
he
flung
aside
and
breasted
the
surge
most
swoln
that
met
him
his
bold
head
bove
the
contentious
waves
he
kept
and
oared
himself
with
his
good
arms
in
lusty
stroke
to
th
shore
that
oer
his
waveworn
basis
bowed
as
stooping
to
relieve
him
i
not
doubt
he
came
alive
to
land
alonso
no
no
hes
gone
sebastian
sir
you
may
thank
yourself
for
this
great
loss
that
would
not
bless
our
europe
with
your
daughter
but
rather
lose
her
to
an
african
where
she
at
least
is
banishd
from
your
eye
who
hath
cause
to
wet
the
grief
ont
alonso
prithee
peace
sebastian
you
were
kneeld
to
and
importund
otherwise
by
all
of

and
the
fair

between
loathness
and
obedience
at
which
end
o
th
beam
should
bow
we
have
lost
your
son
i
fear
for
ever
milan

the
dearst
o

sebastian
why
doth

not
then
our
eyelids
sink
i
find
not
myself
disposd
to

nor
i
my
spirits
are
nimble
they
fell
together
all
as
by
consent
they
droppd
as
by
a
thunderstroke
what
might
worthy
sebastian
o
what
might
no
more
and
yet
methinks
i
see
it
in
thy
face
what
thou
shouldst
be
th
occasion
speaks
thee
and
my
strong
imagination
sees
a
crown
dropping
upon
thy
head
sebastian
what
art
thou
waking
antonio
do
you
not
hear
me
speak
sebastian
i
do
and
surely
it
is
a
sleepy
language
and
thou
speakst
out
of
thy
sleep
what
is
it
thou
didst
say
this
is
a
strange
repose
to
be
asleep
with
eyes
wide
open
standing
speaking
moving
and
yet
so
fast
asleep
antonio
noble
sebastian
thou
letst
thy
fortune
sleepdie
rather
winkst
whiles
thou
art
waking
sebastian
thou
dost
snore
distinctly
theres
meaning
in
thy
snores
antonio
i
am
more
serious
than

hereditary
sloth
instructs
me
antonio
o
if
you
but
knew
how
you
the
purpose
cherish
whiles
thus
you
mock
it
how
in
stripping
it
you
more
invest
it
ebbing
men
indeed
most
often
do
so
near
the
bottom
run
by
their
own
fear
or
sloth
sebastian
prithee
say
on
the
setting
of
thine
eye
and
cheek
proclaim
a
matter
from
thee
and
a
birth
indeed
which
throes
thee
much
to
yield
antonio
thus
sir
although
this
lord
of
weak
remembrance
this
who
shall
be
of
as
little
memory
when

hath
here
almost
persuaded

tis
as
impossible
that
hes
undrownd
as
he
that

o
out
of

no

what
great

have
you
no
hope
that
way

another

so
high
a
hope
that
even

cannot
pierce
a

there
will
you
grant
with

hearing
a
log

ferdinand
there
be
some
sports
are
painful
and
their
labour
delight
in
them
sets
off
some
kinds
of
baseness
are
nobly
undergone
and
most
poor
matters
point
to
rich
ends
this
my
mean
task
would
be
as
heavy
to
me
as
odious
but
the
mistress
which
i
serve
quickens
whats
dead
and
makes
my
labours
pleasures
o
she
is
ten
times
more
gentle
than
her
fathers
crabbed
and
hes
composd
of
harshness
i
must
remove
some
thousands
of
these
logs
and
pile
them
up
upon
a
sore
injunction
my
sweet
mistress
weeps
when
she
sees
me
work
and
says
such
baseness
had
never
like
executor
i
forget
but
these
sweet
thoughts
do
even
refresh
my
labours
most
busy
least
when
i
do
it

enter
miranda
and
prospero
at
a
distance
unseen

miranda
alas
now

up
those
logs
that
you

it
down
and
rest
you
when

for
these
three
hours
ferdinand

ferdinand
no
precious
creature
i
had
rather
crack
my
sinews
break
my
back
than
you
should
such
dishonour
undergo
while
i
sit
lazy
by
miranda
it
would
become
me
as
well
as
it
does
you
and
i
should
do
it
with
much
more
ease
for
my
good
will

eyd
with

and
many
a
time
th
harmony
of
their
tongues
hath
into

brought
my
too
diligent
ear
for
several
virtues
have
i
likd
several
women
never
any
with
so
full
soul
but
some
defect
in
her
did
quarrel
with
the
noblest
grace
she
owd
and
put
it
to
the
foil
but
you
o
you
so
perfect
and
so
peerless
are
created
of
every
creatures
best
miranda
i

my
dear
father

by
my
modesty
the
jewel
in
my
dower
i
would
not
wish
any
companion
in
the
world
but
you
nor
can
imagination
form
a
shape
besides
yourself
to
like

i
prattle
something
too
wildly
and
my
fathers
precepts
i
therein
do
forget
ferdinand
i
am
in
my
condition
a
prince
miranda
i
do
think
a

would
not

no

endure
this
wooden
slavery
than
to

the
fleshfly
blow

mouth

even
infect
my
mouth
i
do
forgive
thy
rankest
faultall
of

require
my
dukedom
of

lost
how
sharp
the
point
of
this
remembrance
is
my
dear
son
ferdinand

i
am
woe
fort
sir
alonso
irreparable
is
the
loss
and
patience
says
it
is
past
her
cure
prospero
i
rather
think
you
have
not
sought
her
help
of
whose
soft
grace
for
the
like
loss
i
have
her
sovereign
aid
and
rest
myself
content
alonso
you
the
like
loss
prospero
as
great
to
me
as
late
and
supportable
to
make

means
much
weaker
than

may
call
to
comfort
you
for
i
have
lost
my
daughter
alonso

oozy
bed
where

son
lies
when
did
you
lose
your
daughter
prospero
in
this
last
tempest

perceive
these
lords
at
this
encounter

so
much
admire
that
they
devour
their
reason
and
scarce
think
their
eyes
do
offices
of
truth
their
words
are
natural
breath
but
howsoeer
you
have
been
justled
from
your
senses

for
certain
that
i
am
prospero
and
that
very
duke
which
was
thrust
forth
of
milan

most
strangely
upon
this
shore
where
you
were
wrecked
was
landed
to
be
the
lord
ont
no
more
yet
of

thine
apperil

i

and
he
sees
em
not
it
grieves
me
to

so
many
dip
their
meat
in
one
mans
blood
and
all
the
madness
is
he
cheers
them
up
too
i
wonder
men
dare
trust
themselves
with
men
methinks
they
should
invite
them
without
knives
good
for
their
meat
and
safer
for
their
lives
theres
much
example
fort
the
fellow
that
sits
next
him
now
parts
bread
with
him
pledges
the
breath
of
him
in
a
divided
draught
is
the
readiest
man
to
kill
him
t
has
been
proved
if
i
were
a
huge
man
i
should
fear
to
drink
at
meals
lest
they
should
spy
my
windpipes
dangerous
notes
great
men
should
drink
with
harness
on
their
throats
timon
my
lord
in
heart
and
let
the
health
go
round
second

my
good
lord
apemantus

he
keeps
his
tides

those
healths
will
make
thee
and
thy
state
look
ill
timon
heres
that
which
is
too
weak
to
be
a
sinner
honest
water
which
neer
left
man
i
th
mire
this
and
my
food
are
equals
theres
no
odds
feasts

too
proud
to

to
the
gods

apemantus
grace

immortal
gods
i
crave
no
pelf
i
pray
for
no
man
but

i
may
never
prove
so
fond
to
trust
man
on
his
oath
or
bond
or
a
harlot
for
her
weeping
or
a
dog
that
seems
asleeping
or
a
keeper
with
my
freedom
or

much
good
dich
thy
good

apemantus
timon
captain
alcibiades
your
hearts
in
the
field
now
alcibiades
my
heart
is
ever
at
your
service
my
lord
timon
you
had
rather
be
at
a
breakfast
of
enemies
than
dinner
of
friends
alcibiades
so
they
were
bleeding
new
my
lord
theres
no
meat
like
em
i
could
wish
my
best
friend
at
such
a
feast
apemantus
would
all
those
flatterers
were
thine
enemies
then
that
then
thou
mightst
kill
em
and
bid
me
to
em
first
lord
might
we
but
have
that
happiness
my
lord
that
you
would
once
use
our
hearts
whereby
we
might
express
some
part
of
our
zeals
we
should
think
ourselves
for
ever
perfect
timon
o
no
doubt
my
good
friends
but
the
gods
themselves
have
provided
that
i
shall
have
much
help
from
you
how
had
you
been
my
friends
else
why
have
you
that
charitable
title
from
thousands
did
not
you
chiefly
belong
to
my
heart
i
have
told
more
of
you
to
myself
than
you
can
with
modesty
speak
in
your
own
behalf
and
thus
far
i
confirm
you
o
you
gods
think
i
what
need
we
have
any
friends
if
we
should
neer
have
need
of
em
they
were
the
most
needless
creatures
living
should
we
neer
have
use
for
em
and
would
most
resemble
sweet
instruments
hung
up
in
cases
that
keep
their
sounds
to
themselves
why
i
have
often
wishd
myself
poorer
that
i
might
come
nearer
to
you
we
are
born
to
do
benefits
and
what
better
or
properer
can
we
call
our
own
than
the
riches
of
our
friends
o
what
a
precious
comfort
tis
to
have
so
many
like
brothers
commanding

three
strangers

lucius
who
the
lord
timon
he
is
my
very
good
friend
and
an
honourable
gentleman
first
stranger
we
know
him
for
no
less
though
we
are
but
strangers
to
him
but
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
my
lord
and
which
i
hear
from
common
rumours
now
lord
timons
happy
hours
are
done
and
past
and
his
estate
shrinks
from
him
lucius
fie
no
do
not
believe
it
he
cannot
want
for
money
second
stranger
but
believe
you
this
my
lord
that
not
long
ago
one
of
his
men
was
with
the
lord
lucullus
to
borrow
so
many
talents
nay
urgd
extremely
fort
and
showed
what
necessity
belongd
tot
and
yet
was
denied
lucius
how
second
stranger
i
tell
you
denied
my
lord
lucius
what
a
strange
case
was
that
now
before
the
gods
i
am
ashamd
ont
denied
that
honourable
man
there
was
very
little
honour
showd
int
for
my
own
part
i
must
needs
confess
i
have
received
some
small
kindnesses
from
him
as
money
plate
jewels
and
suchlike
trifles
nothing
comparing
to
his
yet
had
he
mistook
him
and
sent
to
me
i
should
neer
have
denied
his
occasion
so
many
talents

enter
servilius

servilius
see
by
good
hap
yonders
my
lord
i
have
sweat
to
see
his
honour
my
honourd
lord
lucius
servilius
you
are
kindly
met
sir
fare
thee
well
commend
me
to
thy
honourable
virtuous
lord
my
very
exquisite
friend
servilius
may
it
please
your
honour
my
lord
hath
sent
lucius
ha
what
has
he
sent
i
am
so
much
endeared
to
that
lord
hes
ever
sending
how
shall
i
thank
him
thinkst
thou
and
what
has
he
sent
now
servilius
has
only
sent
his
present
occasion
now
my
lord
requesting
your
lordship
to
supply
his
instant
use
with
so
many
talents
lucius
i
know
his
lordship
is
but
merry
with
me
he
cannot
want
fiftyfive
hundred
talents
servilius
but
in
the
mean
time
he
wants
less
my
lord
if
his
occasion
were
not
virtuous
i
should
not
urge
it
half
so
faithfully
lucius
dost
thou
speak
seriously
servilius
servilius
upon
my
soul
tis
true
sir
lucius
what
a
wicked
beast
was
i
to
disfurnish
myself
against
such
a
good
time
when
i
might
ha
shown
myself
honourable
how
unluckily
it
happned
that
i
should
purchase
the
day
before
for
a
little
part
and
undo
a
great
deal
of
honour
servilius
now
before
the
gods
i
am
not
able
to
do
the
more
beast
i
say
i
was
sending
to
use
lord
timon
myself
these
gentlemen
can
witness
but
i
would
not
for
the
wealth
of
athens
i
had
donet
now
commend
me
bountifully
to
his
good
lordship
and
i
hope
his
honour
will
conceive
the
fairest
of
me
because
i
have
no
power
to
be
kind
and
tell
him
this
from
me
i
count
it
one
of
my
greatest
afflictions
say
that
i
cannot
pleasure
such
an
honourable
gentleman
good
servilius
will
you
befriend
me
so
far
as
to
use
mine
own
words
to
him
servilius
yes
sir
i
shall
lucius
ill
look
you
out
a
good
turn
servilius
exit
servilius
true
as
you
said
timon
is
shrunk
indeed
and
he
thats
once
denied
will
hardly
speed











exit
first
stranger
do
you
observe
this
hostilius
second
stranger
ay
too
well
first
stranger
why
this
is
the
worlds
soul
and
just
of
the
same
piece
is
every
flatterers
spirit
who
can
call
him
his
friend
that
dips
in
the
same
dish
for
in
my
knowing
timon
has
been
this
lords
father
and
kept
his
credit
with
his
purse
supported
his
estate
nay
timons
money
has
paid
his
men
their
wages
he
neer
drinks
but
timons
silver
treads
upon
his
lip
and
yet
o
see
the
monstrousness
of
man
when
he
looks
out
in
an
ungrateful
shape
he
does
deny
him
in
respect
of
his
what
charitable
men
afford
to
beggars
third
stranger
religion
groans
at
it
first
stranger
for
mine
own
part
i
never
tasted
timon
in
my
life
nor
came
any
of
his
bounties
over
me
to
mark
me
for
his
friend
yet
i
protest
for
his
right
noble
mind
illustrious
virtue
and
honourable
carriage
had
his
necessity
made
use
of
me
i
would
have
put
my
wealth
into
donation
and
the
best
half
should
have
returnd
to
him
so
much
i
love
his
heart
but
i
perceive
men
must
learn
now
with
pity
to
dispense
for
policy
sits
above
conscience

at

that
might

known
my

i

his

might
have
wood
me
first
for
in
my
conscience
i
was
the
first
man
that
eer
received
gift
from
him
and
does
he
think
so
backwardly
of
me
now
that
ill
requite
it
last
no
so
it
may
prove
an
argument
of
laughter
to
th
rest
and
i
mongst
lords
be
thought
a
fool
id
rather
than
the
worth
of
thrice
the
sum
had
sent
to
me
first
but
for
my
minds
sake
id
such
a
courage
to
do
him
good

servant
excellent
your
lordships
a
goodly
villain
the
devil
knew
not
what
he
did
when
he
made
man
politic
he
crossd
himself
byt
and
i
cannot
think
but
in
the
end
the
villainies
of
man
will
set
him
clear
how
fairly
this
lord
strives
to
appear
foul
takes
virtuous
copies
to
be
wicked
like
those
that
under
hot
ardent
zeal
would
set
whole
realms
on
fire
of
such
a
nature
is
his
politic
love
this
was
my
lords
best
hope
now
all
are
fled
save
only
the
gods
now
his
friends
are
dead
doors
that
were
neer
acquainted
with
their
wards
many
a
bounteous
year
must
be
employd
now
to
guard
sure
their
master
and
this
is
all
a
liberal
course
allows
who
cannot
keep
his

scene
v
the
senate
house

enter
three
senators
at
one
door
alcibiades
meeting
them
with
attendants

first
senator
my
lord
you
have
my
voice
tot
the
faults
bloody
tis
necessary
he
should
die
nothing
emboldens
sin
so
much
as
mercy
second
senator
most
true
the
law
shall
bruise
him
alcibiades
honour
health
and
compassion
to
the
senate
first
senator
now
captain
alcibiades
i
am
an
humble
suitor
to
your
virtues
for
pity
is
the
virtue
of
the
law
and
none
but
tyrants
use
it
cruelly
it
pleases
time
and
fortune
to
lie
heavy
upon
a
friend
of
mine
who
in
hot
blood
hath
steppd
into
the
law
which
is
past
depth
to
those
that
without
heed
do
plunge
intot
he
is
a
man
setting
his
fate
aside
of
comely
virtues
nor
did
he
soil
the
fact
with
cowardice
an
honour
in
him
which
buys
out
his
fault
but
with
a
noble
fury
and
fair
spirit
seeing
his
reputation
touchd
to
death
he
did
oppose
his
foe
and
with
such
sober
and
unnoted
passion
he
did
behove
his
anger
ere
twas
spent
as
if
he
had
but
provd
an
argument
first
senator
you
undergo
too
strict
a
paradox
striving
to
make
an
ugly
deed
look
fair
your
words
have
took
such
pains
as
if
they
labourd
to
bring
manslaughter
into
form
and
set
quarrelling
upon
the
head
of
valour
which
indeed
is
valour
misbegot
and
came
into
the
world
when
sects
and
factions
were
newly
born
hes
truly
valiant
that
can
wisely
suffer
the
worst
that
man
can
breathe
and
make
his
wrongs
his
outsides
to
wear
them
like
his
raiment
carelessly
and
neer
prefer
his
injuries
to
his
heart
to
bring
it
into
danger
if
wrongs
be
evils
and
enforce
us
kill
what
folly
tis
to
hazard
life
for
ill
alcibiades
my
lord
first
senator
you
cannot
make
gross
sins
look
clear
to
revenge
is
no
valour
but
to
bear
alcibiades
my
lords
then
under
favour
pardon
me
if
i
speak
like
a
captain
why
do
fond
men
expose
themselves
to
battle
and
not
endure
all
threats
sleep
upont
and
let
the
foes
quietly
cut
their
throats
without
repugnancy
if
there
be
such
valour
in
the
bearing
what
make
we
abroad
why
then
women
are
more
valiant
that
stay
at
home
if
bearing
carry
it
and
the
ass
more
captain
than
the
lion
the
fellow
loaden
with
irons
wiser
than
the
judge
if
wisdom
be
in
suffering
o
my
lords
as
you
are
great
be
pitifully
good
who
cannot
condemn
rashness
in
cold
blood
to
kill
i
grant
is
sins
extremest
gust
but
in
defence
by
mercy
tis
most
just
to
be
in
anger
is
impiety
but
who
is
man
that
is
not
angry
weigh
but
the
crime
with
this
second
senator
you
breathe
in
vain
alcibiades
in
vain
his
service
done
at
lacedaemon
and
byzantium
were
a
sufficient
briber
for
his
life
first
senator
whats
that
alcibiades
why
i
say
my
lords
has
done
fair
service
and
slain
in
fight
many
of
your
enemies
how
full
of
valour
did
he
bear
himself
in
the
last
conflict
and
made
plenteous
wounds
second
senator
he
has
made
too
much
plenty
with
em
hes
a
sworn
rioter
he
has
a
sin
that
often
drowns
him
and
takes
his
valour
prisoner
if
there
were
no
foes
that
were
enough
to
overcome
him
in
that
beastly
fury
he
has
been
known
to
commit
outrages
and
cherish
factions
tis
inferrd
to
us
his
days
are
foul
and
his
drink
dangerous
first
senator
he
dies
alcibiades
hard
fate
he
might
have
died
in
war
my
lords
if
not
for
any
parts
in
him
though
his
right
arm
might
purchase
his
own
time
and
be
in
debt
to
none
yet
more
to
move
you
take
my
deserts
to
his
and
join
em
both
and
for
i
know
your
reverend
ages
love
security
ill
pawn
my
victories
all
my
honours
to
you
upon
his
good
returns
if
by
this
crime
he
owes
the
law
his
life
why
let
the
war
receivet
in
valiant
gore
for
law
is
strict
and
war
is
nothing
more
first
senator
we
are
for
law
he
dies
urge
it
no
more
on
height
of
our
displeasure
friend
or
brother
he
forfeits
his
own
blood
that
spills
another
alcibiades
must
it
be
so
it
must
not
be
my
lords
i
do
beseech
you
know
me
second
senator
how
alcibiades
call
me
to
your
remembrances
third
senator
what
alcibiades
i
cannot
think
but
your
age
has
forgot
me
it
could
not
else
be
i
should
prove
so
base
to
sue
and
be
denied
such
common
grace
my
wounds
ache
at
you
first
senator
do
you
dare
our
anger
tis
in
few
words
but
spacious
in
effect
we
banish
thee
for
ever
alcibiades
banish
me
banish
your
dotage
banish
usury
that
makes
the
senate
ugly
first
senator
if
after
two
days
shine
athens
contain
thee
attend
our
weightier
judgment
and
not
to
swell
our
spirit
he
shall
be
executed
presently

the
balsam

senate
pours
into

my
spleen
and
fury
that
i
may
strike
at
athens
ill
cheer
up
my
discontented
troops

lay
for

painter
as
i
took
note
of
the
place
it
cannot
be
far
where
he
abides
poet
to
be
thought
of
him
does
the
rumour
hold
for
true
that
hes
so
full
of
gold
painter
certain
alcibiades
reports
it
phrynia
and
timandra
had
gold
of
him
he
likewise
enrichd
poor
straggling
soldiers
with
great
quantity
tis
said
he
gave
unto
his

a
mighty
sum
poet
then
this
breaking
of
his
has
been
but
a
try
for
his
friends
painter
nothing
else
you
shall
see
him
a

not
amiss
we
tender
our
loves
to
him
in
this
supposd
distress
of
his
it

load
our
purposes
with
what
they
travail
for
if
it
be
just
and
true
report
that
goes
of
his
having
poet
what
have
you
now
to
present
unto
him
painter
nothing
at
this
time
but
my
visitation
only
i
will
promise
him
an
excellent
piece
poet
i
must
serve
him
so
too
tell
him
of
an
intent
thats
coming
toward
him
painter
good
as
the
best
promising
is
the
very
air
o
th
time
it
opens
the
eyes
of
expectation
performance
is
ever
the
duller
for
his
act
and
but
in
the
plainer
and
simpler
kind
of
people
the
deed
of
saying
is
quite
out
of
use
to
promise
is
most
courtly
and
fashionable
performance
is
a
kind
of
will
or
testament
which
argues
a
great
sickness
in
his
judgment
that
makes
it

enter
timon
from
his

excellent
workman
thou
canst
not
paint
a
man
so
bad
as
is
thyself
poet
i
am
thinking
what
i
shall
say
i
have
provided
for
him
it
must
be
a
personating
of
himself
a
satire
against
the
softness
of
prosperity
with
a
discovery
of
the
infinite
flatteries
that
follow
youth
and
opulency
timon
aside
must
thou
needs
stand
for
a
villain
in
thine
own
work
wilt
thou
whip
thine
own
faults
in
other
men
do
so
i
have
gold
for
thee

detested
vale
you

forlorn

overcome
with
moss
and
baleful
mistletoe
here
never
shines
the
sun
here
nothing
breeds
unless
the
nightly
owl
or
fatal
raven
and
when
they
showd
me
this
abhorred
pit
they
told
me
here
at
dead
time
of
the
night
a
thousand
fiends
a
thousand
hissing
snakes
ten
thousand
swelling
toads
as
many
urchins
would
make
such
fearful
and
confused
cries
as
any
mortal
body
hearing
it
should
straight
fall
mad
or
else
die
suddenly
no
sooner
had
they
told
this
hellish
tale
but
straight
they
told
me
they
would
bind
me
here
unto
the
body
of
a
dismal
yew
and
leave
me
to
this
miserable
death
and
then
they
calld
me
foul
adulteress
lascivious
goth
and
all
the
bitterest
terms
that
ever
ear
did
hear
to
such
effect
and
had
you
not
by
wondrous
fortune
come
this
vengeance
on

uncouth
fear

bloody
finger

doth
wear
a
precious
ring
that
lightens
all
this
hole
which
like
a
taper
in
some
monument
doth
shine
upon
the
dead
mans
earthy
cheeks
and
shows
the
ragged
entrails
of
this
pit
so
pale
did
shine
the
moon
on
pyramus
when
he
by
night
lay
bathd
in
maiden
blood

with
thy
fainting

pit

those
sweet
ornaments
whose
circling
shadows
kings
have
sought

in

river
of

bubbling
fountain
stirrd
with
wind
doth
rise

fall
between
thy

lips

hath
deflowered
thee

ah

thou
turnst
away
thy
