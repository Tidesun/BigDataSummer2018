painted
full
of
tongues

rumour
open
your
ears
for
which
of
you
will
stop
the
vent
of
hearing
when
loud
rumour
speaks
i
from
the
orient
to
the
drooping
west
making
the
wind
my
posthorse
still
unfold
the
acts
commenced
on
this
ball
of
earth
upon
my
tongues
continual
slanders
ride
the
which
in
every
language
i
pronounce
stuffing
the
ears
of
men
with
false
reports
i
speak
of
peace
while
covert
emnity
under
the
smile
of
safety
wounds
the
world
and
who
but
rumour
who
but
only
i
make
fearful
musters
and
prepard
defence
whiles
the
big
year
swoln
with
some
other
grief
is
thought
with
child
by
the
stern
tyrant
war
and
no
such
matter
rumour
is
a
pipe
blown
by
surmises
jealousies
conjectures
and
of
so
easy
and
so
plain
a
stop
that
the
blunt
monster
with
uncounted
heads
the
stilldiscordant
wavring
multitude
can
play
upon
it
but
what
need
i
thus
my
wellknown
body
to
anatomize
among
my
household
why
is
rumour
here
i
run
before
king
harrys
victory
who
in
a
bloody
field
by
shrewsbury
hath
beaten
down
young
hotspur
and
his
troops
quenching
the
flame
of
bold
rebellion
even
with
the
rebels
blood
but
what
mean
i
to
speak
so
true
at
first
my
office
is
to
noise
abroad
that
harry
monmouth
fell
under
the
wrath
of
noble
hotspurs
sword
and
that
the
king
before
the
douglas
rage
stoopd
his
anointed
head
as
low
as
death
this
have
i
rumourd
through
the
peasant
towns
between
that
royal
field
of
shrewsbury
and
this
wormeaten
hold
of
ragged
stone
where
hotspurs
father
old
northumberland
lies
craftysick
the
posts
come
tiring
on
and
not
a
man
of
them
brings
other
news
than
they
have
learnt
of
me
from
rumours
tongues
they
bring
smooth

false
worse

wrongs

armed
heels

the
panting
sides
of
his
poor
jade

hilding
fellow
that

life
spoke
at
a
venture
look
here
comes
more
news

enter
morton

northumberland
yea
this
mans
brow
like
to
a
titleleaf
foretells
the
nature
of
a
tragic
volume
so
looks
the
strand
whereon
the
imperious
flood
hath
left
a
witnessd
usurpation
say
morton
didst
thou
come
from
shrewsbury
morton
i
ran
from
shrewsbury
my
noble
lord
where
hateful
death
put
on
his
ugliest
mask
to
fright
our
party
northumberland
how
doth
my
son
and
brother
thou
tremblest
and
the
whiteness
in
thy
cheek
is
apter
than
thy
tongue
to
tell
thy
errand
even
such
a
man
so
faint
so
spiritless
so
dull
so
dread
in
look
so
woebegone
drew
priams
curtain
in
the
dead
of
night
and
would
have
told
him
half
his
troy
was
burnt
but
priam
found
the
fire
ere
he
his
tongue
and
i
my
percys
death
ere
thou
reportst
it
this
thou
wouldst
say
your
son
did
thus
and
thus
your
brother
thus
so
fought
the
noble
douglas
stopping
my
greedy
ear
with
their
bold
deeds
but
in
the
end
to
stop
my
ear
indeed
thou
hast
a
sigh
to
blow
away
this
praise
ending
with
brother
son
and
all
are
dead
morton
douglas
is
living
and
your
brother
yet
but
for
my
lord
your
son
northumberland
why
he
is
dead
see
what
a
ready
tongue
suspicion
hath
he
that
but
fears
the
thing
he
would
not
know
hath
by
instinct
knowledge
from
others
eyes
that
what
he
feard
is
chanced
yet
speak
morton
tell
thou
an
earl
his
divination
lies
and
i
will
take
it
as
a
sweet
disgrace
and
make
thee
rich
for
doing
me
such
wrong
morton
you
are
too
great
to
be
by
me
gainsaid
your
spirit
is
too
true
your
fears
too
certain
northumberland
yet
for
all
this
say
not
that
percys
dead
i
see
a
strange
confession
in
thine
eye
thou
shakst
thy
head
and
holdst
it
fear
or
sin
to
speak
a
truth
if
he
be
slain
say
so
the
tongue
offends
not
that
reports
his
death
and
he
doth
sin
that
doth
belie
the
dead
not
he
which
says
the
dead
is
not
alive
yet
the
first
bringer
of
unwelcome
news
hath
but
a
losing
office
and
his
tongue
sounds
ever
after
as
a
sullen
bell
remembred
tolling
a
departing
friend
lord
bardolph
i
cannot
think
my
lord
your
son
is
dead
morton
i
am
sorry
i
should
force
you
to
believe
that
which
i
would
to
god
i
had
not
seen
but
these
mine
eyes
saw
him
in
bloody
state
rendring
faint
quittance
wearied
and
outbreathd
to
harry
monmouth
whose
swift
wrath
beat
down
the
neverdaunted
percy
to
the
earth
from
whence
with
life
he
never
more
sprung
up
in
few
his
death
whose
spirit
lent
a
fire
even
to
the
dullest
peasant
in
his
camp
being
bruited
once
took
fire
and
heat
away
from
the
besttemperd
courage
in
his
troops
for
from
his
metal
was
his
party
steeled
which
once
in
him
abated
an
the
rest
turnd
on
themselves
like
dull
and
heavy
lead
and
as
the
thing
thats
heavy
in
itself
upon
enforcement
flies
with
greatest
speed
so
did
our
men
heavy
in
hotspurs
loss
lend
to
this
weight
such
lightness
with
their
fear
that
arrows
fled
not
swifter
toward
their
aim
than
did
our
soldiers
aiming
at
their
safety
fly
from
the
field
then
was
that
noble
worcester
too
soon
taen
prisoner
and
that
furious
scot
the
bloody
douglas
whose
welllabouring
sword
had
three
times
slain
th
appearance
of
the
king
gan
vail
his
stomach
and
did
grace
the
shame
of
those
that
turnd
their
backs
and
in
his
flight
stumbling
in
fear
was
took
the
sum
of
all
is
that
the
king
hath
won
and
hath
sent
out
a
speedy
power
to
encounter
you
my
lord
under
the
conduct
of
young
lancaster
and
westmoreland
this
is
the
news
at
full
northumberland
for
this
i
shall
have
time
enough
to
mourn
in
poison
there
is
physic
and
these
news
having
been
well
that
would
have
made
me
sick
being
sick
have
in
some
measure
made
me
well
and
as
the
wretch
whose
feverweakned
joints
like
strengthless
hinges
buckle
under
life
impatient
of
his
fit
breaks
like
a
fire
out
of
his
keepers
arms
even
so
my
limbs
weakned
with
grief
being
now
enragd
with
grief
are
thrice
themselves
hence
therefore
thou
nice
crutch
a
scaly
gauntlet
now
with
joints
of
steel
must
glove
this
hand
and
hence
thou
sickly
coif
thou
art
a
guard
too
wanton
for
the
head
which
princes
fleshd
with
conquest
aim
to
hit
now
bind
my
brows
with
iron
and
approach
the
raggedst
hour
that
time
and
spite
dare
bring
to
frown
upon
th
enragd
northumberland
let
heaven
kiss
earth
now
let
not
natures
hand
keep
the
wild
flood
confind
let
order
die
and
let
this
world
no
longer
be
a
stage
to
feed
contention
in
a
lingring
act
but
let
one
spirit
of
the
firstborn
cain
reign
in
all
bosoms
that
each
heart
being
set
on
bloody
courses
the
rude
scene
may
end
and
darkness
be
the
burier
of
the
dead
lord
bardolph
this
strained
passion
doth
you
wrong
my
lord
morton
sweet
earl
divorce
not
wisdom
from
your
honour
the
lives
of
all
your
loving
complices
lean
on
your
health
the
which
if
you
give
oer
to
stormy
passion
must
perforce
decay
you
cast
th
event
of
war
my
noble
lord
and
summd
the
account
of
chance
before
you
said
let
us
make
head
it
was
your
presurmise
that
in
the
dole
of
blows
your
son
might
drop
you
knew
he
walkd
oer
perils
on
an
edge
more
likely
to
fall
in
than
to
get
oer
you
were
advisd
his
flesh
was
capable
of
wounds
and
scars
and
that
his
forward
spirit
would
lift
him
where
most
trade
of
danger
rangd
yet
did
you
say
go
forth
and
none
of
this
though
strongly
apprehended
could
restrain
the
stiffborne
action
what
hath
then
befalln
or
what
hath
this
bold
enterprise
brought
forth
more
than
that
being
which
was
like
to
be
lord
bardolph
we
all
that
are
engaged
to
this
loss
knew
that
we
ventured
on
such
dangerous
seas
that
if
we
wrought
out
life
twas
ten
to
one
and
yet
we
venturd
for
the
gain
proposd
chokd
the
respect
of
likely
peril
feard
and
since
we
are
oerset
venture
again
come
we
will
put
forth
body
and
goods
morton
tis
more
than
time
and
my
most
noble
lord
i
hear
for
certain
and
dare
speak
the
truth
the
gentle
archbishop
of
york
is
up
with
wellappointed
powrs
he
is
a
man
who
with
a
double
surety
binds
his
followers
my
lord
your
son
had
only
but
the
corpse
but
shadows
and
the
shows
of
men
to
fight
for
that
same
word
rebellion
did
divide
the
action
of
their
bodies
from
their
souls
and
they
did
fight
with
queasiness
constraind
as
men
drink
potions
that
their
weapons
only
seemd
on
our
side
but
for
their
spirits
and
souls
this
word
rebellion
it
had
froze
them
up
as
fish
are
in
a
pond
but
now
the
bishop
turns
insurrection
to
religion
supposd
sincere
and
holy
in
his
thoughts
hes
followd
both
with
body
and
with
mind
and
doth
enlarge
his
rising
with
the
blood
of
fair
king
richard
scrapd
from
pomfret
stones
derives
from
heaven
his
quarrel
and
his
cause
tells
them
he
doth
bestride
a
bleeding
land
gasping
for
life
under
great
bolingbroke
and
more
and
less
do
flock
to
follow
him
northumberland
i
knew
of
this
before
but
to
speak
truth
this
present
grief
had
wipd
it
from
my
mind
go
in
with
me
and
counsel
every
man
the
aptest
way
for
safety
and
revenge
get
posts
and
letters
and
make
friends
with
speed
never
so
few
and
never
yet
more

and
buckler

falstaff
sirrah
you
giant
what
says
the
doctor
to
my
water
page
he
said
sir
the
water
itself
was
a
good
healthy
water
but
for
the
party
that
owed
it
he
might
have
moe
diseases
than
he
knew
for
falstaff
men
of
all
sorts
take
a
pride
to
gird
at
me
the
brain
of
this
foolishcompounded
clay
man
is
not
able
to
invent
anything
that
intends
to
laughter
more
than
i
invent
or
is
invented
on
me
i
am
not
only
witty
in
myself
but
the
cause
that
wit
is
in
other
men
i
do
here
walk
before
thee
like
a
sow
that
hath
overwhelmd
all
her
litter
but
one
if
the
prince
put
thee
into
my
service
for
any
other
reason
than
to
set
me
off
why
then
i
have
no
judgment
thou
whoreson
mandrake
thou
art
fitter
to
be
worn
in
my
cap
than
to
wait
at
my
heels
i
was
never
mannd
with
an
agate
till
now
but
i
will
inset
you
neither
in
gold
nor
silver
but
in
vile
apparel
and
send
you
back
again
to
your
master
for
a
jewel
the
juvenal
the
prince
your
master
whose
chin
is
not
yet
fledge
i
will
sooner
have
a
beard
grow
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
than
he
shall
get
one
off
his
cheek
and
yet
he
will
not
stick
to
say
his
face
is
a
faceroyal
god
may
finish
it
when
he

some
smack
of
age
in

relish
of
the
saltness
of
time
and
i
most
humbly
beseech
your

to
have
a
reverend
care
of
your
health
chief

sir

discomfort
from

i
talk
not
of
his
majesty
you
would
not
come
when
i
sent
for

into
this

whoreson
apoplexy
chief
justice
well
god

him
i
pray
you
let
me
speak
with
you

this
apoplexy

kind
of
lethargy

please
your
lordship
a
kind
of
sleeping
in
the
blood
a
whoreson
tingling
chief
justice
what
tell
you
me
of
it
be
it
as
it
is
falstaff
it
hath
it
original
from
much
grief
from
study
and
perturbation
of
the
brain
i
have
read
the
cause
of
his
effects
in
galen
it
is
a
kind
of
deafness
chief
justice
i
think
you
are
falln
into
the
disease
for
you
hear
not
what
i
say
to
you
falstaff
very
well
my
lord
very
well
rather
ant
please
you
it
is
the
disease
of
not
listening
the
malady
of
not
marking
that
i
am
troubled
withal
chief
justice
to
punish
you
by
the
heels
would
amend
the
attention
of
your
ears

i
care
not
if
i
do
become
your
physician
falstaff
i
am
as
poor
as

my
lord
but
not
so
patient
your
lordship
may
minister
the
potion

imprisonment
to
me
in

of
poverty

how
i
should
be
your
patient
to
follow
your
prescriptions

make
some
dram
of
a
scruple
or
indeed
a
scruple

you
when
there
were
matters
against

well
i
am
loath
to
gall

up

down
like
his
ill
angel
falstaff
not
so
my

your
ill
angel
is
light
but

hope
he
that
looks
upon
me
will
take
me
without
weighing
and
yet
in
some
respects
i
grant
i
cannot
go
i
cannot
tell
virtue

thomas

the

marshal
lord
hastings
and
lord
bardolph

archbishop
thus
have
you
heard
our
cause
and
known
our
means
and
my
most
noble
friends
i
pray
you
all
speak
plainly
your
opinions
of
our
hopes
and
first
lord
marshal
what
say
you
to
it
mowbray
i
well
allow
the
occasion
of
our
amis
but
gladly
would
be
better
satisfied
how
in
our
means
we
should
advance
ourselves
to
look
with
forehead
bold
and
big
enough
upon
the
power
and
puissance
of
the
king
hastings
our
present
musters
grow
upon
the
file
to
five
and
twenty
thousand
men
of
choice
and
our
supplies
live
largely
in
the
hope
of
great
northumberland
whose
bosom
burns
with
an
incensed
fire
of
injuries
lord
bardolph
the
question
then
lord
hastings
standeth
thus
whether
our
present
five
and
twenty
thousand
may
hold
up
head
without
northumberland
hastings
with
him
we
may
lord
bardolph
yea
marry
theres
the
point
but
if
without
him
we
be
thought
too
feeble
my
judgment
is
we
should
not
step
too
far
till
we
had
his
assistance
by
the
hand
for
in
a
theme
so
bloodyfacd
as
this
conjecture
expectation
and
surmise
of
aids
incertain
should
not
be
admitted
archbishop
tis
very
true
lord
bardolph
for
indeed
it
was
young
hotspurs
case
at
shrewsbury
lord
bardolph
it
was
my
lord
who
lind
himself
with
hope
eating
the
air
and
promise
of
supply
flattring
himself
in
project
of
a
power
much
smaller
than
the
smallest
of
his
thoughts
and
so
with
great
imagination
proper
to
madmen
led
his
powers
to
death
and
winking
leapt
into
destruction
hastings
but
by
your
leave
it
never
yet
did
hurt
to
lay
down
likelihoods
and
forms
of
hope
lord
bardolph
yes
if
this
present
quality
of
war
indeed
the
instant
action
a
cause
on
foot
lives
so
in
hope
as
in
an
early
spring
we
see
th
appearing
buds
which
to
prove
fruit
hope
gives
not
so
much
warrant
as
despair
that
frosts
will
bite
them
when
we
mean
to
build
we
first
survey
the
plot
then
draw
the
model
and
when
we
see
the
figure
of
the
house
then
we
must
rate
the
cost
of
the
erection
which
if
we
find
outweighs
ability
what
do
we
then
but
draw
anew
the
model
in
fewer
offices
or
at
least
desist
to
build
at
all
much
more
in
this
great
work
which
is
almost
to
pluck
a
kingdom
down
and
set
another
up
should
we
survey
the
plot
of
situation
and
the
model
consent
upon
a
sure
foundation
question
surveyors
know
our
own
estate
how
able
such
a
work
to
undergo
to
weigh
against
his
opposite
or
else
we
fortify
in
paper
and
in
figures
using
the
names
of
men
instead
of
men
like
one
that
draws
the
model
of
a
house
beyond
his
power
to
build
it
who
half
through
gives
oer
and
leaves
his
partcreated
cost
a
naked
subject
to
the
weeping
clouds
and
waste
for
churlish
winters
tyranny
hastings
grant
that
our
hopes
yet
likely
of
fair
birth
should
be
stillborn
and
that
we
now
possessd
the
utmost
man
of
expectation
i
think
we
are
so
a
body
strong
enough
even
as
we
are
to
equal
with
the
king
lord
bardolph
what
is
the
king
but
five
and
twenty
thousand
hastings
to
us
no
more
nay
not
so
much

bardolph

his
divisions
as
the
times

brawl
are
in
three
heads

power
against
the
french
and

against
glendower
perforce
a
third
must
take
up
us
so
is
the
unfirm
king
in
three
divided
and
his
coffers
sound
with
hollow
poverty
and
emptiness
archbishop
that
he
should
draw
his
several
strengths
together
and
come
against
us
in
full
puissance
need
not
be
dreaded
hastings
if
he
should
do
so
he
leaves
his
back
unarmd
the

scene
ii
london
another
street

enter
prince
henry
and
poins

prince
before
god
i
am
exceeding
weary
poins
ist
come
to
that
i
had
thought
weariness
durst
not
have
attachd
one
of
so
high
blood
prince
faith
it
does
me
though
it
discolours
the
complexion
of
my
greatness
to
acknowledge
it
doth
it
not
show
vilely
in
me
to
desire
small
beer
poins
why
a
prince
should
not
be
so
loosely
studied
as
to
remember
so
weak
a
composition
prince
belike
then
my
appetite
was
notprincely
got
for
by
my
troth
i
do
now
remember
the
poor
creature
small
beer
but
indeed
these
humble
considerations
make
me
out
of
love
with
my
greatness
what
a
disgrace
is
it
to
me
to
remember
thy
name
or
to
know
thy
face
tomorrow
or
to
take
note
how
many
pair
of
silk
stockings
thou
hast
viz
these
and
those
that
were
thy
peachcolourd
ones
or
to
bear
the
inventory
of
thy
shirts
as
one
for
superfluity
and
another
for
use
but
that
the
tenniscourtkeeper
knows
better
than
i
for
it
is
a
low
ebb
of
linen
with
thee
when
thou
keepest
not
racket
there
as
thou
hast
not
done
a
great
while
because
the
rest
of
thy
low
countries
have
made
a
shift
to
eat
up
thy
holland
and
god
knows
whether
those
that
bawl
out
of
the
ruins
of
thy
linen
shall
inherit
his
kingdom
but
the
midwives
say
the
children
are
not
in
the
fault
whereupon
the
world
increases
and
kindreds
are
mightily
strengthened
poins
how
ill
it
follows
after
you
have
laboured
so
hard
you
should
talk
so
idly
tell
me
how
many
good
young
princes
would
do
so
their
fathers
being
so
sick
as
yours
at
this
time
is
prince
shall
i
tell
thee
one
thing
poins
poins
yes
faith
and
let
it
be
an
excellent
good
thing
prince
it
shall
serve
among
wits
of
no
higher
breeding
than
thine
poins
go
to
i
stand
the
push
of
your
one
thing
that
you
will
tell
prince
marry
i
tell
thee
it
is
not
meet
that
i
should
be
sad
now
my
father
is
sick
albeit
i
could
tell
to
thee
as
to
one
it
pleases
me
for
fault
of
a
better
to
call
my
friend
i
could
be
sad
and
sad
indeed
too
poins
very
hardly
upon
such
a
subject
prince
by
this
hand
thou
thinkest
me
as
far
in
the
devils
book
as
thou
and
falstaff
for
obduracy
and
persistency
let
the
end
try
the
man
but
i
tell
thee
my
heart
bleeds
inwardly
that
my
father
is
so
sick
and
keeping
such
vile
company
as
thou
art
hath
in
reason
taken
from
me
all
ostentation
of
sorrow
poins
the
reason
prince
what
wouldst
thou
think
of
me
if
i
should
weep
poins
i
would
think
thee
a
most
princely
hypocrite
prince
it
would
be
every
mans
thought
and
thou
art
a
blessed
fellow
to
think
as
every
man
thinks
never
a
mans
thought
in
the
world
keeps
the
roadway
better
than
thine
every
man
would
think
me
an
hypocrite
indeed
and
what
accites
your
most
worshipful
thought
to
think
so
poins
why
because
you
have
been
so
lewd
and
so
much
engraffed
to
falstaff
prince
and
to
thee
poins
by
this
light
i
am
well
spoke
on
i
can
hear
it
with
mine
own
ears
the
worst
that
they
can
say
of
me
is
that
i
am
a
second
brother
and
that
i
am
a
proper
fellow
of
my
hands
and
those
two
things
i
confess
i
cannot

i

thee
loving

gentle
daughter
give
even

unto
my
rough
affairs
put
not
you
on
the
visage
of
the
times
and
be
like

to
percy
troublesome
lady
northumberland
i

no

you
will
your

be
your

northumberland
alas
sweet

my
honour
is
at
pawn
and
but
my
going
nothing
can
redeem
it
lady
percy
o
yet
for
gods
sake
go
not
to
these
wars
the
time
was
father
that
you
broke
your
word
when
you
were
more
endeard
to
it
than
now
when
your
own
percy
when
my
hearts
dear
harry
threw
many
a
northward
look
to
see
his
father
bring
up
his
powers
but
he
did
long
in
vain
who
then
persuaded
you
to
stay
at
home
there
were
two
honours
lost
yours
and
your
sons
for
yours
the
god
of
heaven
brighten
it
for
his
it
stuck
upon
him
as
the
sun
in
the
grey
vault
of
heaven
and
by
his
light
did
all
the
chivalry
of
england
move
to
do
brave
acts
he
was
indeed
the
glass
wherein
the
noble
youth
did
dress
themselves
he
had
no
legs
that
practisd
not
his
gait
and
speaking
thick
which
nature
made
his
blemish
became
the
accents
of
the
valiant
for
those
who
could
speak
low
and
tardily
would
turn
their
own
perfection
to
abuse
to
seem
like
him
so
that
in
speech
in
gait
in
diet
in
affections
of
delight
in
military
rules
humours
of
blood
he
was
the
mark
and
glass
copy
and
book
that
fashiond
others
and
him
o
wondrous
him
o
miracle
of
men
him
did
you
leave
second
to
none
unseconded
by
you
to
look
upon
the
hideous
god
of
war
in
disadvantage
to
abide
a
field
where
nothing
but
the
sound
of
hotspurs
name
did
seem
defensible
so
you
left
him
never
o
never
do
his
ghost
the
wrong
to
hold
your
honour
more
precise
and
nice
with
others
than
with
him
let
them
alone
the
marshal
and
the
archbishop
are
strong
had
my
sweet
harry
had
but
half
their
numbers
today
might
i
hanging
on
hotspurs
neck
have
talkd
of
monmouths
grave
northumberland
beshrew
your
heart
fair
daughter
you
do
draw
my
spirits
from
me
with
new
lamenting
ancient
oversights
but
i
must
go
and
meet
with
danger
there
or
it
will
seek
me
in
another
place
and
find
me
worse
provided
lady
northumberland
o
fly
to
scotland
till
that
the
nobles
and
the
armed
commons
have
of
their
puissance
made
a
little
taste
lady
percy
if
they
get
ground
and
vantage
of
the
king
then
join
you
with
them
like
a
rib
of
steel
to
make
strength
stronger
but
for
all
our
loves
first
let
them
try
themselves
so
did
your
son
he
was
so
suffred
so
came
i
a
widow
and
never
shall
have
length
of
life
enough
to
rain
upon
remembrance
with
mine
eyes
that
it
may
grow
and
sprout
as
high
as
heaven
for
recordation
to
my
noble
husband
northumberland
come
come
go
in

me
tis
with
my

as
with
the
tide
swelld
up
unto
his
height
that
makes

running
neither
way
fain
would
i
go
to
meet
the

how
many
thousands
of
my
poorest
subjects
are
at
this
hour
asleep
o
sleep
o
gentle
sleep
natures
soft
nurse
how
have
i
frightened
thee
that
thou
no
more
will
weigh
my
eyelids
down
and
steep
my
senses
in
forgetfulness
why
rather
sleep
liest
thou
in
smoky
cribs
upon
uneasy
pallets
stretching
thee
and
hushd
with
buzzing
nightflies
to
thy
slumber
than
in
the
perfumd
chambers
of
the
great
under
the
canopies
of
costly
state
and
lulld
with
sound
of
sweetest
melody
o
thou
dull
god
why
liest
thou
with
the
vile
in
loathsome
beds
and
leavst
the
kingly
couch
a
watchcase
or
a
common
larumbell
wilt
thou
upon
the
high
and
giddy
mast
seal
up
the
shipboys
eyes
and
rock
his
brains
in
cradle
of
the
rude
imperious
surge
and
in
the
visitation
of
the
winds
who
take
the
ruffian
billows
by
the
top
curling
their
monstrous
heads
and
hanging
them
with
deafing
clamour
in
the
slippery
clouds
that
with
the
hurly
death
itself
awakes
canst
thou
o
partial
sleep
give
thy
repose
to
the
wet
seaboy
in
an
hour
so
rude
and
in
the
calmest
and
most
stillest
night
with
all
appliances
and
means
to
boot
deny
it
to
a
king
then
happy
low
lie
down
uneasy
lies
the

that
wears

enter
warwick
and
surrey

warwick
many
good
morrows
to
your
majesty
king
is
it
good
morrow
lords
warwick
tis
one
oclock
and
past
king
why
then
good
morrow
to
you
all
my
lords
have
you
read
oer
the
letters
that
i
sent
you
warwick
we
have
my
liege
king
then
you
perceive
the
body
of
our
kingdom
how
foul
it
is
what
rank
diseases
grow
and
with
what
danger
near
the
heart
of
it
warwick
it
is
but
as
a
body
yet
distempered
which
to
his
former
strength
may
be
restored
with
good
advice
and
little
medicine
my
lord
northumberland
will
soon
be
coold
king
o
god
that
one
might
read
the
book
of
fate
and
see
the
revolution
of
the
times
make
mountains
level
and
the
continent
weary
of
solid
firmness
melt
itself
into
the
sea
and
other
times
to
see
the
beachy
girdle
of
the
ocean
too
wide
for
neptunes
hips
how
chances
mock
and
changes
fill
the
cup
of
alteration
with
divers
liquors
o
if
this
were
seen
the
happiest
youth
viewing
his
progress
through
what
perils
past
what
crosses
to
ensue
would
shut
the
book
and
sit
him
down
and
die
tis
not
ten
years
gone
since
richard
and
northumberland
great
friends
did
feast
together
and
in
two
years
after
were
they
at
wars
it
is
but
eight
years
since
this
percy
was
the
man
nearest
my
soul
who
like
a
brother
toild
in
my
affairs
and
laid
his
love
and
life
under
my
foot
yea
for
my
sake
even
to
the
eyes
of
richard
gave
him
defiance
but
which
of
you
was
by
to
warwick

you
cousin
nevil
as
i
may
remember
when
richard
with
his
eye
brim
full
of
tears
then
checkd
and
rated
by
northumberland
did
speak
these
words
now
provd
a
prophecy
northumberland
thou
ladder
by
the
which
my
cousin
bolingbroke
ascends
my
throne
though
then
god
knows
i
had
no
such
intent
but
that
necessity
so
bowd
the
state
that
i
and
greatness
were
compelld
to
kiss
the
time
shall
come
thus
did
he
follow
it
the
time
will
come
that
foul
sin
gathering
head
shall
break
into
corruption
so
went
on
foretelling
this
same
times
condition
and
the
division
of
our
amity
warwick
there
is
a
history
in
all
mens
lives
figuring
the
natures
of
the
times
deceasd
the
which
observd
a
man
may
prophesy
with
a
near
aim
of
the
main
chance
of
things
as
yet
not
come
to
life
who
in
their
seeds
and
weak
beginning
lie
intreasured
such
things
become
the
hatch
and
brood
of
time
and
by
the
necessary
form
of
this
king
richard
might
create
a
perfect
guess
that
great
northumberland
then
false
to
him
would
of
that
seed
grow
to
a
greater
falseness
which
should

shall
please
your
grace
archbishop
here
stand
my
lords
and
send
discoverers
forth

know
the
numbers
of
our
enemies
hastings
we
have
sent
forth
already
archbishop
tis
well
done
my
friends
and
brethren
in
these
great
affairs
i
must
acquaint
you
that
i
have
receivd
newdated
letters
from
northumberland
their
cold
intent
tenour
and
substance
thus
here
doth
he
wish
his
person
with
such
powers
as
might
hold
sortance
with
his
quality
the
which
he
could
not
levy
whereupon
he
is
retird
to
ripe
his
growing
fortunes
to
scotland
and
concludes
in
hearty
prayers
that
your
attempts
may
overlive
the
hazard
and
fearful
meeting
of
their
opposite
mowbray
thus
do
the
hopes
we
have
in
him
touch
ground
and
dash
themselves
to
pieces

enter
a
messenger

hastings
now
what
news
messenger
west
of
this
forest
scarcely
off
a
mile
in
goodly
form
comes
on
the
enemy
and
by
the
ground
they
hide
i
judge
their
number
upon
or
near
the
rate
of
thirty
thousand
mowbray
the
just
proportion
that
we
gave
them
out
let
us
sway
on
and
face
them
in
the
field

enter
westmoreland

archbishop
what
wellappointed
leader
fronts
us
here
mowbray
i
think
it
is
my
lord
of
westmoreland
westmoreland
health
and
fair
greeting
from
our
general
the
prince
lord
john
and
duke
of
lancaster
archbishop
say
on
my
lord
of
westmoreland
in
peace
what
doth
concern
your
coming
westmoreland
then
my
lord
unto
your
grace
do
i
in
chief
address
the
substance
of
my
speech
if
that
rebellion
came
like
itself
in
base
and
abject
routs
led
on
by
bloody
youth
guarded
with
rags
and
countenancd
by
boys
and
beggary
i
say
if
damnd
commotion
so
appeard
in
his
true
native
and
most
proper
shape
you
reverend
father
and
these
noble
lords
had
not
been
here
to
dress
the
ugly
form
of
base
and
bloody
insurrection
with
your
fair
honours
you
lord
archbishop
whose
see
is
by
a
civil
peace
maintaind
whose
beard
the
silver
hand
of
peace
hath
touchd
whose
learning
and
good
letters
peace
hath
tutord
whose
white
investments
figure
innocence
the
dove
and
very
blessed
spirit
of
peace
wherefore
you
do
so
ill
translate
yourself
out
of
the
speech
of
peace
that
bears
such
grace
into
the
harsh
and
boistrous
tongue
of
war
turning
your
books
to
graves
your
ink
to
blood
your
pens
to
lances
and
your
tongue
divine
to
a
loud
trumpet
and
a
point
of
war
archbishop
wherefore
do
i
this
so
the
question
stands
briefly
to
this
end
we
are
all
diseasd
and
with
our
surfeiting
and
wanton
hours
have
brought
ourselves
into
a
burning
fever
and
we
must
bleed
for
it
of
which
disease
our
late
king
richard
being
infected
died
but
my
most
noble
lord
of
westmoreland
i
take
not
on
me
here
as
a
physician
nor
do
i
as
an
enemy
to
peace
troop
in
the
throngs
of
military
men
but
rather
show
awhile
like
fearful
war
to
diet
rank
minds
sick
of
happiness
and
purge
th
obstructions
which
begin
to
stop
our
very
veins
of
life
hear
me
more
plainly
i
have
in
equal
balance
justly
weighd
what
wrongs
our
arms
may
do
what
wrongs
we
suffer
and
find
our
griefs
heavier
than
our
offences
we
see
which
way
the
stream
of
time
doth
run
and
are
enforcd
from
our
most
quiet
there
by
the
rough
torrent
of
occasion
and
have
the
summary
of
all
our
griefs
when
time
shall
serve
to
show
in
articles
which
long
ere
this
we
offerd
to
the
king
and
might
by
no
suit
gain
our
audience
when
we
are
wrongd
and
would
unfold
our
griefs
we
are
denied
access
unto
his
person
even
by
those
men
that
most
have
done
us
wrong
the
dangers
of
the
days
but
newly
gone
whose
memory
is
written
on
the
earth
with
yet
appearing
blood
and
the
examples
of
every
minutes
instance
present
now
hath
put
us
in
these
illbeseeming
arms
not
to
break
peace
or
any
branch
of
it
but
to
establish
here
a
peace
indeed
concurring
both
in
name
and
quality
westmoreland
when
ever
yet
was
your
appeal
denied
wherein
have
you
been
galled
by
the
king
what
peer
hath
been
subornd
to
grate
on
you
that
you
should
seal
this
lawless
bloody
book
of
forgd
rebellion
with
a
seal
divine
and
consecrate
commotions
bitter
edge
archbishop
my
brother
general
the
commonwealth
to
brother
horn
an
household
cruelty
i
make
my
quarrel
in
particular
westmoreland
there
is
no
need
of
any
such
redress
or
if
there
were
it
not
belongs
to
you
mowbray
why
not
to
him
in
part
and
to
us
all
that
feel
the
bruises
of
the
days
before
and
suffer
the
condition
of
these
times
to
lay
a
heavy
and
unequal
hand
upon
our
honours
westmoreland
o
my
good
lord
mowbray
construe
the
times
to
their
necessities
and
you
shall
say
indeed
it
is
the
time
and
not
the
king
that
doth
you
injuries
yet
for
your
part
it
not
appears
to
me
either
from
the
king
or
in
the
present
time
that
you
should
have
an
inch
of
any
ground
to
build
a
grief
on
were
you
not
restord
to
all
the
duke
of
norfolks
signiories
your
noble
and
right
wellremembred
fathers
mowbray
what
thing
in
honour
had
my
father
lost
that
need
to
be
revivd
and
breathd
in
me
the
king
that
lovd
him
as
the
state
stood
then
was
force
perforce
compelld
to
banish
him
and
then
that
henry
bolingbroke
and
he
being
mounted
and
both
roused
in
their
seats
their
neighing
coursers
daring
of
the
spur
their
armed
staves
in
charge
their
beavers
down
their
eyes
of
fire
sparkling
through
sights
of
steel
and
the
loud
trumpet
blowing
them
together
then
then
when
there
was
nothing
could
have
stayd
my
father
from
the
breast
of
bolingbroke
o
when
the
king
did
throw
his
warder
down
his
own
life
hung
upon
the
staff
he
threw
then
threw
he
down
himself
and
all
their
lives
that
by
indictment
and
by
dint
of
sword
have
since
miscarried
under
bolingbroke
westmoreland
you
speak
lord
mowbray
now
you
know
not
what
the
earl
of
hereford
was
reputed
then
in
england
the
most
valiant
gentleman
who
knows
on
whom
fortune
would
then
have
smild
but
if
your
father
had
been
victor
there
he
neer
had
borne
it
out
of
coventry
for
all
the
country
in
a
general
voice
cried
hate
upon
him
and
all
their
prayers
and
love
were
set
on
hereford
whom
they
doted
on
and
blessd
and
gracd
indeed
more
than
the
king
but
this
is
mere
digression
from
my
purpose
here
come
i
from
our
princely
general
to
know
your
griefs
to
tell
you
from
his
grace
that
he
will
give
you
audience
and
wherein
it
shall
appear
that
your
demands
are
just
you
shall
enjoy
them
everything
set
off
that
might
so
much
as
think
you
enemies
mowbray
but
he
hath
forcd
us
to
compel
this
offer
and
it
proceeds
from
policy
not
love
westmoreland
mowbray
you
overween
to
take
it
so
this
offer
comes
from
mercy
not
from
fear
for
lo
within
a
ken
our
army
lies
upon
mine
honour
all
too
confident
to
give
admittance
to
a
thought
of
fear
our
battle
is
more
full
of
names
than
yours
our
men
more
perfect
in
the
use
of
arms
our
armour
all
as
strong
our
cause
the
best
then
reason
will
our
hearts
should
be
as
good
say
you
not
then
our
offer
is
compelld
mowbray
well
by
my
will
we
shall
admit
no
parley
westmoreland
that
argues
but
the
shame
of
your
offence
a
rotten
case
abides
no
handling
hastings
hath
the
prince
john
a
full
commission
in
very
ample
virtue
of
his
father
to
hear
and
absolutely
to
determine
of
what
conditions
we
shall
stand
upon
westmoreland
that
is
intended
in
the
generals
name
i
muse
you
make
so
slight
a
question
archbishop
then
take
my
lord
of
westmoreland
this
schedule
for
this
contains
our
general
grievances
each
several
article
herein
redressd
all
members
of
our
cause
both
here
and
hence
that
are
insinewed
to
this
action
acquitted
by
a
true
substantial
form
and
present
execution
of
our
wills
to
us
and
to
our
purposes
confind
we
come
within
our
awful
banks
again
and
knit
our
powers
to
the
arm
of
peace
westmoreland
this
will
i
show
the
general
please
you
lords
in
sight
of
both
our
battles
we
may
meet
and
either
end
in
peace
which

frame
or
to
the
place
of
diffrence
call
the
swords
which
must
decide
it
archbishop
my
lord
we
will
do
so









exit
westmoreland
mowbray
there
is
a
thing
within
my
bosom
tells
me
that
no
conditions
of
our
peace
can
stand
hastings
fear
you
not
that
if
we
can
make
our
peace
upon
such
large
terms
and
so
absolute
as
our
conditions
shall
consist
upon
our
peace
shall
stand
as
firm
as
rocky
mountains
mowbray
yea
but
our
valuation
shall
be
such
that
every
slight
and
falsederived
cause
yea
every
idle
nice
and
wanton
reason
shall
to
the
king
taste
of
this
action
that
were
our
royal
faiths
martyrs
in
love
we
shall
be
winnowd
with
so
rough
a
wind
that
even
our
corn
shall
seem
as
light
as
chaff
and
good
from
bad
find
no
partition
archbishop
no
no
my
lord
note
this
the
king
is
weary
of
dainty
and
such
picking
grievances
for
he
hath
found
to
end
one
doubt
by
death
revives
two
greater
in
the
heirs
of
life
and
therefore
will
he
wipe
his
tables
clean
and
keep
no
telltale
to
his
memory
that
may
repeat
and
history
his
los
to
new
remembrance
for
full
well
he
knows
he
cannot
so
precisely
weed
this
land
as
his
misdoubts
present
occasion
his
foes
are
so
enrooted
with
his
friends
that
plucking
to
unfix
an
enemy
he
doth
unfasten
so
and
shake
a
friend
so
that
this
land
like
an
offensive
wife
that
hath
enragd
him
on
to
offer
strokes
as
he
is
striking
holds
his
infant
up
and
hangs
resolvd
correction
in
the
arm
that
was
upreard
to
execution
hastings
besides
the
king
hath
wasted
all
his
rods
on
late
offenders
that
he
now
doth
lack
the
very
instruments
of
chastisement
so
that
his
power
like
to
a
fangless
lion
may
offer
but
not
hold
archbishop
tis
very
true
and
therefore
be
assurd
my
good
lord
marshal
if
we
do
now
make
our
atonement
well
our
peace
will
like
a
broken
limb
united
grow
stronger
for
the
breaking
mowbray
be
it
so

your

hear
with
reverence
your
exposition
on
the
holy
text

now
to
see
you
here
an
iron
man
cheering
a
rout
of
rebels
with
your
drum
turning
the
word
to
sword
and
life
to
death
that
man
that
sits
within
a
monarchs
heart
and
ripens
in
the
sunshine
of
his
favour
would
he
abuse
the
countenance
of
the
king
alack
what
mischiefs
might
he
set
abroach

such
greatness
with
you
lord

who
hath
not
heard

spoken
how
deep
you
were
within

books
of
god
to
us
the
speaker
in
his
parliament
to
us
th
imagind
voice
of
god
himself
the
very
opener
and
intelligencer
between
the
grace
the
sanctities
of
heaven
and
our
dull
workings
o
who
shall
believe
but
you
misuse
the
reverence
of
your
place
employ
the
countenance
and
grace
of
heavn
as
a
false
favourite
doth
his
princes
name
in
deeds
dishonourable
you
have
taen
up
under
the
counterfeited
zeal
of

the
subjects
of

both
against

upswarmd
them
archbishop
good
my
lord
of

i
am
not
here
against
your
fathers
peace
but
as
i
told
my
lord
of
westmoreland
the
time
misordred
doth
in
common
sense
crowd
us
and
crush
us
to
this
monstrous
form
to
hold
our
safety
up
i
sent
your
grace
the
parcels
and
particulars
of
our
grief

which
hath
been
with
scorn
shovd
from

this
hydra
son
of

dangerous
eyes
may
well
be
charmd
asleep

most
just

madness

of
majesty
mowbray
if

try
our
fortunes
to
the
last
man
hastings
and
though
we
here
fall
down
we
have
supplies
to
second
our
attempt

they
miscarry
theirs

so
success
of
mischief

up
whiles

shallow

much
to
shallow
to
sound
the
bottom
of

them
directly
how
far
forth
you
do
like
their
articles

do
allow
them
well
and
swear

been
mistook

some
about

lavishly
wrested
his

authority
my
lord
these
griefs
shall
be

falstaff
i
would
you

but
the

twere
better
than
your

good
faith
this
same
young
soberblooded
boy
doth
not
love
me
nor
a
man
cannot
make
him
laugh
but
thats
no
marvel
he
drinks
no
wine
theres
never
none
of
these
demure
boys
come
to
any
proof
for
thin
drink
doth
so
overcool
their
blood
and
making
many
fishmeals
that
they
fall
into
a
kind
of
male
greensickness
and
then
when
they
marry
they
get
wenches
they
are
generally
fools
and
cowardswhich
some
of
us
should
be
too
but
for
inflammation
a
good
sherrissack
hath
a
twofold
operation
in
it
it
ascends
me
into
the
brain
dries
me
there
all
the
foolish
and
dull
and
crudy
vapours
which
environ
it
makes
it
apprehensive
quick
forgetive
full
of
nimble
fiery
and
delectable
shapes
which
delivered
oer
to
the
voice
the
tongue
which
is
the
birth
becomes
excellent
wit
the
second
property
of
your
excellent
sherris
is
the
warming
of
the
blood
which
before
cold
and
settled
left
the
liver
white
and
pale
which
is
the
badge
of
pusillanimity
and
cowardice
but
the
sherris
warms
it
and
makes
it
course
from
the
inwards
to
the
parts
extremes
it
illumineth
the
face
which
as
a
beacon
gives
warning
to
all
the
rest
of
this
little
kingdom
man
to
arm
and
then
the
vital
commoners
and
inland
petty
spirits
muster
me
all
to
their
captain
the
heart
who
great
and
puffd
up
with
this
retinue
doth
any
deed
of
courage
and
this
valour
comes
of
sherris
so
that
skill
in
the
weapon
is
nothing
without
sack
for
that
sets
it
awork
and
learning
a
mere
hoard
of
gold
kept
by
a
devil
till
sack
commences
it
and
sets
it
in
act
and
use
hereof
comes
it
that
prince
harry
is
valiant
for
the
cold
blood
he
did
naturally
inherit
of
his
father
he
hath
like
lean
sterile
and
bare
land
manured
husbanded
and
tilld
with
excellent
endeavour
of
drinking
good
and
good
store
of
fertile
sherris
that
he
is
become
very
hot
and
valiant
if
i
had
a
thousand
sons
the
first
humane
principle
i
would
teach
them
should
be
to
forswear
thin
potations
and
to
addict
themselves
to

if

that
bleedeth
at

we

what

how

thy

he
loves
thee
and
thou
dost
neglect
him
thomas
thou
hast
a

cherish

my

and
noble
offices
thou
mayst
effect
of
mediation
after
i
am
dead

therefore
omit
him
not
blunt
not
his
love
nor
lose
the
good
advantage
of
his
grace
by
seeming
cold
or
careless
of
his

for
he
is
gracious
if
he
be
observd
he
hath
a
tear
for
pity
and
a
hand
open
as
day
for
melting
charity
yet
notwithstanding
being
incensd
he
is
flint
as
humorous
as
winter
and
as
sudden
as
flaws
congealed
in
the
spring
of
day
his
temper
therefore
must
be
well
observd
chide
him
for
faults
and
do
it
reverently
when
you
perceive
his
blood
inclind
to
mirth
but
being
moody
give
him
line
and
scope
till
that
his
passions
like
a

confound
themselves

thou

with

why

most

is
the
fattest
soil
to

my

stretches

beyond

the

imaginary
thunguided

times
that
you

am
sleeping
with

for
when
his
headstrong
riot
hath
no
curb
when
rage
and
hot
blood
are
his
counsellors
when
means
and
lavish
manners
meet
together
o
with
what
wings
shall
his

fly
towards
fronting
peril
and
opposd
decay
warwick
my
gracious
lord
you
look
beyond
him
quite
the

but
studies
his

like
a

wherein
to
gain

tis
needful
that
the
most
immodest
word
be
lookd
upon

learnt
which
once
attaind
your
highness
knows
comes
to
no
further
use
but
to
be
known

hated
so
like
gross
terms
the
prince
will
in
the
perfectness
of
time
cast
off
his
followers
and
their
memory
shall
as
a

an
hour
of

prince
o
pardon
me
my
liege
but
for
my
tears
the
moist
impediments
unto
my
speech
i
had
forestalld
this
dear
and
deep
rebuke
ere
you
with
grief
had
spoke
and
i
had
heard
the
course
of
it
so
far
there
is
your
crown
and
he
that
wears
the
crown
immortally
long
guard
it
yours

kneeling

if
i
affect
it
more
than
as
your
honour
and
as
your
renown
let
me
no
more
from
this
obedience
rise
which
my
most
inward
true
and
duteous
spirit
teacheth
this
prostrate
and
exterior
bending
god
witness
with
me
when
i
here
came
in
and
found
no
course
of
breath
within
your
majesty
how
cold
it
struck
my
heart
if
i
do
feign
o
let
me
in
my
present
wildness
die
and
never
live
to
show
th
incredulous
world
the
noble
change
that
i
have
purposed
coming
to
look
on
you
thinking
you
dead
and
dead
almost
my
liege
to
think
you
were
i
spake
unto
this
crown
as
having
sense
and
thus
upbraided
it
the
care
on
thee
depending
hath
fed
upon
the
body
of
my
father
therefore
thou
best
of
gold
art
worst
of
gold
other
less
fine
in
carat
is
more
precious
preserving
life
in
medcine
potable
but
thou
most
fine
most
honourd
most
renownd
hast
eat
thy
bearer
up
thus
my
most
royal
liege
accusing
it
i
put
it
on
my
head
to
try
with
it
as
with
an
enemy
that
had
before
my
face
murdred
my
father
the
quarrel
of
a
true
inheritor
but
if
it
did
infect
my
blood
with
joy
or
swell
my
thoughts
to
any
strain
of
pride
if
any
rebel
or
vain
spirit
of
mine
did
with
the
least
affection
of
a
welcome
give
entertainment
to
the
might
of
it
let
god
for
ever
keep
it
from
my
head
and
make
me
as
the
poorest
vassal
is
that
doth
with
awe
and
terror
kneel
to
it
king
o
my
son
god
put
it
in
thy
mind
to
take
it
hence
that
thou
mightst
win
the
more
thy
fathers
love
pleading
so
wisely
in
excuse
of
it
come
hither
harry
sit
thou
by
my
bed
and
hear
i
think
the
very
latest
counsel
that
ever
i
shall
breathe
god
knows
my
son
by
what
bypaths
and
indirect
crookd
ways
i
met
this
crown
and
i
myself
know
well
how
troublesome
it
sat
upon
my
head
to
thee
it
shall
descend
with
better
quiet
better
opinion
better
confirmation
for
all
the
soil
of
the
achievement
goes
with
me
into
the
earth
it
seemd
in
me
but
as
an
honour
snatchd
with
boistrous
hand
and
i
had
many
living
to
upbraid
my
gain
of
it
by
their
assistances
which
daily
grew
to
quarrel
and
to
bloodshed
wounding
supposed
peace
all
these
bold
fears
thou
seest
with
peril
i
have
answered
for
all
my
reign
hath
been
but
as
a
scene
acting
that
argument
and
now
my
death
changes
the
mood
for
what
in
me
was
purchasd
falls
upon
thee
in
a
more
fairer
sort
so
thou
the
garland
wearst
successively
yet
though
thou
standst
more
sure
than
i
could
do
thou
art
not
firm
enough
since
griefs
are
green
and
all
my
friends
which
thou
must
make
thy
friends
have
but
their
stings
and
teeth
newly
taen
out
by
whose
fell
working
i
was
first
advancd
and
by
whose
power
i
well
might
lodge
a
fear
to
be
again
displacd
which
to
avoid
i
cut
them
off
and
had
a
purpose
now
to
lead
out
many
to
the
holy
land
lest
rest
and
lying
still
might
make
them
look
too
near
unto
my
state
therefore
my
harry
be
it
thy
course
to
busy
giddy
minds
with
foreign
quarrels
that
action
hence
borne
out
may
waste
the
memory
of
the
former
days
more
would
i
but
my
lungs
are
wasted
so
that
strength
of
speech
is
utterly
denied
me
how
i
came
by
the
crown
o
god
forgive
and
grant
it
may
with
thee
in
true
peace
live
prince
my
gracious
liege
you
won
it
wore
it
kept
it
gave
it
me
then
plain
and
right
must
my
possession
be
which
i
with
more
than
with
a
common
pain
gainst
all
the
world
will
rightfully
maintain

is
able
to
speak
for
himself
when
a
knave
is
not
i
have
servd
your
worship
truly
sir
this
eight
years
an
i
cannot
once
or
twice
in
a
quarter
bear
out
a
knave
against
an
honest
man
i
have
but
a
very
little
credit
with
your
worship
the
knave
is
mine
honest
friend
sir
therefore
i
beseech
you
let
him
be
countenancd
shallow
go
to
i
say
he
shall
have
no
wrong
look
about
davy

exit

where
are
you
sir
john
come
come
come
off
with
your
boots
give
me
your
hand
master
bardolph
bardolph
i
am
glad
to
see
your
worship
shallow
i
thank
thee
with
all
my
heart
kind
master
bardolph
to
the
page

and
welcome
my
tall
fellow
come
sir
john
falstaff
ill
follow
you
good
master
robert
shallow
exit
shallow

bardolph
look
to
our
horses

exeunt
bardolph
and
page

if
i
were
sawed
into
quantities
i
should
make
four
dozen
of
such
bearded
hermits
staves
as
master
shallow
it
is
a
wonderful
thing
to
see
the
semblable
coherence
of
his
mens
spirits
and
his
they
by
observing
of
him
do
bear
themselves
like
foolish
justices
he
by
conversing
with
them
is
turned
into
a
justicelike
servingman
their
spirits
are
so
married
in
conjunction
with
the
participation
of
society
that
they
flock
together
in
consent
like
so
many
wild
geese
if
i
had
a
suit
to
master
shallow
i
would
humour
his
men
with
the
imputation
of
being
near
their
master
if
to
his
men
i
would
curry
with
master
shallow
that
no
man
could
better
command
his
servants
it
is
certain
that
either
wise
bearing
or
ignorant
carriage
is
caught
as
men
take
diseases
one
of
another
therefore
let
men
take
heed
of
their
company
i
will
devise
matter
enough
out
of
this
shallow
to
keep
prince
harry
in
continual
laughter
the
wearing
out
of
six
fashions
which
is
four
terms
or
two
actions
and
a
shall
laugh
without
intervallums
o
it
is
much
that
a
lie
with
a
slight
oath
and
a
jest
with
a
sad
brow
will
do
with
a
fellow
that
never
had
the
ache
in
his
shoulders
o
you
shall
see
him
laugh
till
his
face
be
like
a
wet
cloak
ill
laid
up
shallow

i
am
assurd
if
i
be
measurd
rightly
your

hath
no
just
cause
to
hate
me
king
no
how
might
a
prince
of
my
great
hopes
forget
so
great
indignities
you
laid
upon
me
what
rate
rebuke
and
roughly
send
to
prison
th
immediate
heir
of
england
was
this
easy
may
this
be
washd
in
lethe
and
forgotten
chief
justice
i
then
did
use
the
person
of
your
father
the
image
of
his
power
lay
then
in
me
and
in
th
administration
of
his
law
whiles
i
was
busy
for
the
commonwealth
your
highness
pleased
to
forget
my
place
the
majesty
and
power
of
law
and
justice
the
image
of
the
king
whom
i
presented
and
struck
me
in
my
very
seat
of
judgment
whereon
as
an
offender
to
your
father
i
gave
bold
way
to
my
authority
and
did
commit
you
if
the
deed
were
ill
be
you
contented
wearing
now
the
garland
to
have
a
son
set
your
decrees
at
nought
to
pluck
down
justice
from
your
awful
bench
to
trip
the
course
of
law
and
blunt
the
sword
that
guards
the
peace
and
safety
of
your
person
nay
more
to
spurn
at
your
most
royal
image
and
mock
your
workings
in
a
second
body
question
your
royal
thoughts
make
the
case
yours
be
now
the
father
and
propose
a
son
hear
your
own
dignity
so
much
profand
see
your
most
dreadful
laws
so
loosely
slighted
behold
yourself
so
by
a
son
disdaind
and
then
imagine
me
taking
your
part
and
in
your
power
soft
silencing
your
son
after
this
cold
considerance
sentence
me
and
as
you
are
a
king
speak
in
your
state
what
i
have
done
that
misbecame
my
place
my
person
or
my
lieges
sovereignty
king
you
are
right
justice
and
you
weigh
this
well
therefore
still
bear
the
balance
and
the
sword
and
i
do
wish
your
honours
may
increase
till
you
do
live
to
see
a
son
of
mine
offend
you
and
obey
you
as
i
did
so
shall
i
live
to
speak
my
fathers
words
happy
am
i
that
have
a
man
so
bold
that
dares
do
justice
on
my
proper
son
and
not
less
happy
having
such
a
son
that
would
deliver
up
his
greatness
so
into
the
hands
of
justice
you
did
commit
me
for
which
i
do
commit
into
your
hand
th
unstained
sword
that
you
have
usd
to
bear
with
this
remembrance
that
you
use
the
same
with
the
like
bold
just
and
impartial
spirit
as
you
have
done
gainst
me
there
is
my
hand
you
shall
be
as
a
father
to
my
youth
my
voice
shall
sound
as
you
do
prompt
mine
ear
and
i
will
stoop
and
humble
my
intents
to
your
wellpractisd
wise
directions
and
princes
all
believe
me
i
beseech
you
my
father
is
gone
wild
into
his
grave
for
in
his
tomb
lie
my
affections
and
with
his
spirits
sadly
i
survive
to
mock
the
expectation
of
the
world
to
frustrate
prophecies
and
to
raze
out
rotten
opinion
who
hath
writ
me
down
after
my
seeming
the
tide
of
blood
in
me
hath
proudly
flowd
in
vanity
till
now
now
doth
it
turn
and
ebb
back
to
the
sea
where
it
shall
mingle
with
the
state
of
floods
and
flow
henceforth
in
formal
majesty
now
call
we
our
high
court
of
parliament
and
let
us
choose
such
limbs
of
noble
counsel
that
the
great
body
of
our

may
go
in
equal
rank
with
the

that
war

may

be
it
known
to
you
as
it
is
very
well
i
was
lately
here
in
the
end
of
a
displeasing
play
to
pray
your
patience
for
it
and
to
promise
you
a
better
i
meant
indeed
to
pay
you
with

which
if
like
an
ill
venture
it
come
unluckily
home
i
break
and
you
my

i
promisd

i
would
be

here
i
commit
my
body
to
your
mercies
bate
me
some
and
i
will
pay
you
some
and
as
most
debtors
do
promise
you
infinitely
and
so
i
kneel
down
before
you
but
indeed
to
pray
for
the
queen
if
my
tongue
cannot
entreat
you
to
acquit
me
will
you
command
me
to
use
my
legs
and
yet
that
were
but
light
paymentto
dance
out
of
your
debt
but
a
good
conscience
will
make
any
possible
satisfaction
and
so
would
i
all
the
gentlewomen
here
have
forgiven
me
if
the
gentlemen
will
not
then
the
gentlemen
do
not
agree
with
the
gentlewomen
which
was
never
seen
before
in
such
an
assembly
one
word
more
i
beseech
you
if
you
be
not
too
much
cloyd
with
fat
meat
our
humble
author
will
continue
the
story
with
sir
john
in
it
and
make
you
merry
with
fair
katherine
of
france
where
for
anything
i
know
falstaff
shall
die
of
a
sweat
unless
already
a
be
killed
with
your
hard
opinions
for
oldcastle
died
a
martyr
and
this
is
not

my
tongue
is
weary
when
my
legs
are
too
i

archbishop
of
canterbury
and
the
bishop
of

canterbury
my
lord
ill
tell
you
that
self
bill
is
urgd
which
in
th
eleventh
year
of
the
last
kings
reign
was
like
and
had
indeed
against
us
passd
but
that
the
scambling
and
unquiet
time
did
push
it
out
of
farther
question
ely
but
how
my
lord
shall
we
resist
it
now
canterbury
it
must
be
thought
on
if
it
pass
against
us
we
lose
the
better
half
of
our
possession
for
all
the
temporal
lands
which
men
devout
by
testament
have
given
to
the
church
would
they
strip
from
us
being
valud
thus
as
much
as
would
maintain
to
the
kings
honour
full
fifteen
earls
and
fifteen
hundred
knights
six
thousand
and
two
hundred
good
esquires
and
to
relief
of
lazars
and
weak
age
of
indigent
faint
souls
past
corporal
toil
a
hundred
almshouses
right
well
supplied
and
to
the
coffers
of
the
king
beside
a
thousand
pounds
by
th
year
thus
runs
the
bill
ely
this
would
drink
deep
canterbury
t
would
drink
the
cup
and
all
ely
but
what
prevention
canterbury
the
king
is
full
of
grace
and
fair
regard
ely
and
a
true
lover
of
the
holy
church
canterbury
the
courses
of
his
youth
promisd
it
not
the
breath
no
sooner
left
his
fathers
body
but
that
his
wildness
mortified
in
him
seemd
to
die
too
yea
at
that
very
moment
consideration
like
an
angel
came
and
whippd
th
offending
adam
out
of
him
leaving
his
body
as
a
paradise
tenvelop
and
contain
celestial
spirits
never
was
such
a
sudden
scholar
made
never
came
reformation
in
a
flood
with
such
a
heady
currance
scouring
faults
nor
never
hydraheaded
wilfulnes
so
soon
did
lose
his
seat
and
all
at
once
as
in
this
king
ely
we
are
blessed
in
the
change
canterbury
hear
him
but
reason
in
divinity
and
alladmiring
with
an
inward
wish
you
would
desire
the
king
were
made
a
prelate
hear
him
debate
of
commonwealth
affairs
you
would
say
it
hath
been
all
in
all
his
study
list
his
discourse
of
war
and
you
shall
hear
a
fearful
battle
rendred
you
in
music
turn
him
to
any
cause
of
policy
the
gordian
knot
of
it
he
will
unloose
familiar
as
his
garter
that
when
he
speaks
the
air
a
charterd
libertine
is
still
and
the
mute
wonder
lurketh
in
mens
ears
to
steal
his
sweet
and
honeyd
sentences
so
that
the
art
and
practic
part
of
life
must
be
the
mistress
to
this
theoric
which
is
a
wonder
how
his
grace
should
glean
it
since
his
addiction
was
to
courses
vain
his
companies
unletterd
rude
and
shallow
his
hours
filld
up
with
riots
banquets
sports
and
never
noted
in
him
any
study
any
retirement
any
sequestration
from
open
haunts
and
popularity
ely
the
strawberry
grows
underneath
the
nettle
and
wholesome
berries
thrive
and
ripen
best
neighbourd
by
fruit
of
baser
quality
and
so
the
prince
obscurd
his
contemplation
under
the
veil
of
wildness
which
no
doubt
grew
like
the
summer
grass
fastest
by
night
unseen
yet
crescive
in
his
faculty
canterbury
it
must
be
so
for
miracles
are
ceasd
and
therefore
we
must
needs
admit
the
means
how
things
are
perfected
ely
but
my
good
lord
how
now
for
mitigation
of
this
bill
urgd
by
the
commons
doth
his
majesty
incline
to
it
or
no
canterbury
he
seems
indifferent
or
rather
swaying
more
upon
our
part
than
cherishing
th
exhibiters
against
us
for
i
have
made
an
offer
to
his
majesty
upon
our
spiritual
convocation
and
in
regard
of
causes
now
in
hand
which
i
have
opend
to
his
grace
at
large
as
touching
france
to
give
a
greater
sum
than
ever
at
one
time
the
clergy
yet
did
to
his
predecessors
part
withal
ely
how
did
this
offer
seem
receivd
my
lord
canterbury
with
good
acceptance
of
his
majesty
save
that
there
was
not
time
enough
to
hear
as
i
perceivd
his
grace
would
fain
have
done
the
severals
and
unhidden
passages
of
his
true
tides
to
some
certain
dukedoms
and
generally
to
the
crown
and
seat
of
france
derivd
from
edward
his
greatgrandfather
ely
what
was
th
impediment
that
broke
this
off
canterbury
the
french
ambassador
upon
that
instant
cravd
audience
and
the
hour
i
think
is
come
to
give
him
hearing
is
it
four
oclock
ely
it
is
canterbury
then
go
we
in
to
know
his
embassy
which
i
could
with
a
ready
guess
declare
before
the
frenchman
speak
a
word
of
it
ely
ill
wait
upon
you
and
i
long
to
hear
it

and
believe
in

that
what
you

is
in

washd
as
pure
as

canterbury
then
hear
me
gracious
sovereign
and
you
peers
that
owe
yourselves
your
lives
and
services
to
this
imperial
throne
there
is
no
bar
to
make
against
your
highness
claim
to
france
but
this
which
they
produce
from
pharamond
in
terram
salicam
mulieres
ne
succedant
no
woman
shall
succeed
in
salique
land
which
salique
land
the
french
unjustly
gloze
to
be
the
realm
of
france
and
pharamond
the
founder
of
this
law
and
female
bar
yet
their
own
authors
faithfully
affirm
that
the
land
salique
is
in
germany
between
the
floods
of
sala
and
of
elbe
where
charles
the
great
having
subdud
the
saxons
there
left
behind
and
settled
certain
french
who
holding
in
disdain
the
german
women
for
some
dishonest
manners
of
their
life
establishd
then
this
law
to
wit
no
female
should
be
inheritrix
in
salique
land
which
salique
as
i
said
twixt
elbe
and
sala
is
at
this
day
in
germany
calld
meisen
then
doth
it
well
appear
the
salique
law
was
not
devised
for
the
realm
of
france
nor
did
the
french
possess
the
salique
land
until
four
hundred
one
and
twenty
years
after
defunction
of
king
pharamond
idly
supposd
the
founder
of
this
law
who
died
within
the
year
of
our
redemption
four
hundred
twentysix
and
charles
the
great
subdud
the
saxons
and
did
seat
the
french
beyond
the
river

in
the
year
eight
hundred
five
besides
their
writers
say
king
pepin
which
deposed
childeric
did
as
heir
general
being
descended
of
blithild
which
was
daughter
to

make

and

to
the

hugh

also
who
usurpd

crown
of
charles
the
duke
of

sole
heir
male
of
the
true
line
and
stock
of
charles
the
great
to
find
his
title
with
some
shows
of
truth
though
in
pure
truth
it
was
corrupt
and
naught
conveyd
himself
as
th
heir
to
th
lady
lingare
daughter
to
charlemain
who
was
the
son
to
lewis
the

and
lewis
the
son
of
charles
the

also
king
lewis
the
tenth
who
was
sole
heir
to
the
usurper
capet
could
not
keep
quiet
in
his
conscience
wearing
the
crown
of
france
till
satisfied
that
fair
queen
isabel
his
grandmother
was
lineal
of

by
the

unto

howbeit
they
would
hold
up
this
salique

to
bar
your
highness

rather

on

french
ground
playd
a
tragedy
making
defeat

whiles
his
most
mighty
father
on

hill
stood
smiling
to
behold
his
lions
whelp
forage
in
blood
of
french
nobility
o
noble
english
that
could
entertain
with
half
their
forces
the
full
pride
of

and
let
another
half
stand
laughing
by
all
out
of
work
and
cold
for

ely
awake
remembrance
of
these
valiant
dead
and
with
your
puissant

renew
their
feats
you
are
their
heir
you
sit
upon
their

the
blood
and
courage
that
renowned
them
runs
in
your

my
thricepuissant

of
his

ripe
for
exploits
and
mighty
enterprises
exeter
your
brother
kings

monarchs
of

do
all

that
you
should
rouse
yourself
as
did
the
former
lions
of
your
blood
westmoreland
they
know
your
grace
hath
cause
and
means
and
might
so
hath
your
highness
never
king
of
england
had
nobles
richer
and
more
loyal
subjects
whose
hearts
have
left
their
bodies
here
in
england
and
lie
paviliond
in
the
fields
of
france
canterbury
o
let
their
bodies
follow
my
dear
liege
with
blood
and
sword
and
fire
to
win
your
right
in
aid
whereof
we
of
the
spiritualty
will
raise
your
highness
such
a
mighty
sum
as
never
did
the
clergy
at
one
time
bring
in
to
any
of
your
ancestors
king
henry
we
must
not
only
arm
t
invade
the
french
but
lay
down
our
proportions
to
defend
against
the
scot
who
will
make
road
upon
us
with
all
advantages
canterbury
they
of
those
marches
gracious
sovereign
shall
be
a
wall
sufficient
to
defend
our
inland
from
the
pilfering
borderers
king
henry
we
do
not
mean
the
coursing
snatchers
only
but
fear
the
main
intendment
of
the
scot
who
hath
been
still
a
giddy
neighbour
to
us
for
you
shall
read
that
my
greatgrandfather
never
went
with
his
forces
into
france
but
that
the
scot
on
his
unfurnishd
kingdom
came
pouring
like
the
tide
into
a
breach
with
ample
and
brim
fulness
of
his
force
galling
the
gleaned
land
with
hot
assays
girdling
with
grievous
siege
castles
and
towns
that
england
being
empty
of
defence
hath
shook
and
trembled
at
th
ill
neighbourhood
canterbury
she
hath
been
then
more
feard
than
harmd
my
liege
for
hear
her
but
exampled
by
herself
when
all
her
chivalry
hath
been
in
france
and
she
a
mourning
widow
of
her
nobles
she
hath
herself
not
only
well
defended
but
taken
and
impounded
as
a
stray
the
king
of
scots
whom
she
did
send
to
france
to
fill
king
edwards
fame
with
prisoner
kings
and
make
her
chronicle
as
rich
with
praise
as
is
the
ooze
and
bottom
of
the
sea
with
sunken
wreck
and
sumless
treasuries
westmoreland
but
theres
a
saying
very
old
and
true

if
that
you
will
france
win
then
with
scotland
first
begin

for
once
the
eagle
england
being
in
prey
to
her
unguarded
nest
the
weasel
scot
comes
sneaking
and
so
sucks
her
princely
eggs
playing
the
mouse
in
absence
of
the
cat
to
tear
and
havoc
more
than
she
can
eat
exeter
it
follows
then
the
cat
must
stay
at
home
yet
that
is
but
a
crushd
necessity
since
we
have
locks
to
safeguard
necessaries
and
pretty
traps
to
catch
the
petty
thieves
while
that
the
armed
hand
doth
fight
abroad
th
advised
head
defends
itself
at
home
for
government
though
high
and
low
and
lower
put
into
parts
doth
keep
in
one
consent
congreeing
in
a
full
and
natural
close
like
music
canterbury
therefore
doth
heaven
divide
the
state
of
man
in
divers
functions
setting
endeavour
in
continual
motion
to
which
is
fixed
as
an
aim
or
but
obedience
for
so
work
the
honey
bees
creatures
that
by
a
rule
in
nature
teach
the
act
of
order
to
a
peopled
kingdom
they
have
a
king
and
officers
of
sorts
where
some
like
magistrates
correct
at
home
others
like
merchants
venture
trade
abroad
others
like
soldiers
armed
in
their
stings
make
boot
upon
the
summers
velvet
buds
which
pillage
they
with
merry
march
bring
home
to
the
tentroyal
of
their
emperor
who
busied
in
his
majesty
surveys
the
singing
masons
building
roofs
of
gold
the
civil
citizens
kneading
up
the
honey
the
poor
mechanic
porters
crowding
in
their
heavy
burdens
at
his
narrow
gate
the
sadeyd
justice
with
his
surly
hum
delivering
oer
to
executors
pale
the
lazy
yawning
drone
i
this
infer
that
many
things
having
full
reference
to
one
consent
may
work
contrariously
as
many
arrows
loosed
several
ways
come
to
one
mark
as
many
ways
meet
in
one
town
as
many
fresh
streams
meet
in
one
salt
sea
as
many
lines
close
in
the
dials

so
many
a
thousand
actions
once
afoot
end
in

purpose

therefore
to

my

divide
your
happy
england
into
four
whereof
take
you
one
quarter
into

and
you
withal
shall
make
all

shake
if
we
with
thrice
such
powers
left
at

cannot
defend

being

well
bend

almost
kingly
dukedoms

lay

bones
in

urn
tombless
with
no

either
our
history
shall
with

now
are
we
well
prepard
to
know
the
pleasure
of
our
fair
cousin
dauphin
for
we
hear
your
greeting
is
from
him
not
from
the
king
ambassador
mayt
please
your
majesty
to
give
us
leave
freely
to
render
what
we
have
in
charge
or
shall
we
sparingly
show
you
far
of
the
dauphins
meaning
and
our
embassy
king
henry
we
are
no
tyrant
but
a
christian
king
unto
whose
grace
our
passion
is
as
subject
as
are
our
wretches
fettred
in
our
prisons
therefore
with
frank
and
with
uncurbed
plainness
tell
us
the
dauphins
mind
ambassador
thus
then
in
few
your
highness
lately
sending
into
france
did
claim
some
certain
dukedoms
in
the
right
of
your
great
predecessor
king
edward
the
third
in
answer
of
which
claim
the
prince
our
master
says
that
you
savour
too
much
of
your
youth
and
bids
you
be
advisd
theres
nought
in
france
that
can
be
with
a
nimble
galliard
won
you
cannot
revel
into
dukedoms
there
he
therefore
sends
you
meeter
for
your
spirit
this
tun
of
treasure
and
in
lieu
of
this
desires
you
let
the
dukedoms
that
you
claim
hear
no
more
of
you
this
the
dauphin
speaks
king
henry
what
treasure
uncle
exeter
tennisballs
my
liege
king
henry
we
are
glad
the
dauphin
is
so
pleasant
with
us
his
present
and
your
pains
we
thank
you
for
when
we
have
matchd
our
rackets
to
these
balls
we
will
in
france
by
gods
grace
play
a
set
shall
strike
his
fathers
crown
into
the
hazard
tell
him
he
hath
made
a
match
with
such
a
wrangler
that
all
the
courts
of
france
will
be
disturbd
with
chaces
and
we
understand
him
well
how
he
comes
oer
us
with
our
wilder
days
not
measuring
what
use
we
made
of
them
we
never
valud
this
poor
seat
of
england
and
therefore
living
hence
did
give
ourself
to
barbarous
licence
as
tis
ever
common
that
men
are
merriest
when
they
are
from
home
but
tell
the
dauphin
i
will
keep
my
state
be
like
a
king
and
show
my
sail
of
greatness
when
i
do
rouse
me
in
my
throne
of
france
for
that
i
have
laid
by
my
majesty
and
plodded
like
a
man
for
workingdays
but
i
will
rise
there
with
so
full
a
glory
that
i
will
dazzle
all
the
eyes
of
france
yea
strike
the
dauphin
blind
to
look
on
us
and
tell
the
pleasant
prince
this
mock
of
his
hath
turnd
his
balls
to
gunstones
and
his
soul
shall
stand
sore
charged
for
the
wasteful
vengeance
that
shall
fly
with
them
for
many
a
thousand
widows
shall
this
his
mock
mock
of
their
dear
husbands
mock
mothers
from
their
sons
mock
castles
down
and
some
are
yet
ungotten
and
unborn
that
shall
have
cause
to
curse
the
dauphins
scorn
but
this
lies
all
within
the
will
of
god
to
whom
i
do
appeal
and
in
whose
name
tell
you
the
dauphin
i
am
coming
on
to
venge
me
as
i
may
and
to
put
forth
my
rightful
hand
in
a
wellhallowd
cause
so
get
you
hence
in
peace
and
tell
the
dauphin
his
jest
will
savour
but
of
shallow
wit
when
thousands
weep
more
than
did
laugh
at
it
convey
them
with
safe
conduct
fare
you
well
exeunt
ambassadors
exeter
this
was
a
merry
message
king
henry
we
hope
to
make
the
sender
blush
at
it
therefore
my
lords
omit
no
happy
hour
that
may
give
furthrance
to
our
expedition
for
we
have
now
no
thought
in
us
but
france
save
those
to
god
that
run
before
our
business
therefore
let
our
proportions
for
these
wars
be
soon
collected
and
all
things
thought
upon
that
may
with
reasonable
swiftness
ad
more
feathers
to
our
wings
for
god
before
well
chide
this
dauphin
at
his
fathers
door
therefore
let
every
man
now
task
his
thought
that
this
fair
action
may
on
foot
be
brought

thats
mercy

appeal
king

the
mercy
that

but
late
by
your

counsel

suppressd
and
killd
you
must
not
dare
for
shame
to
talk
of
mercy
for
your
own
reasons
turn
into
your
bosoms
as
dogs
upon
their
masters
worrying
you
see
you
my
princes
and
my
noble
peers
these
english
monsters
my
lord
of
cambridge
here
you
know
how
apt
our
love
was
to
accord
to
furnish
him
with
an
appertinents
belonging
to
his
honour
and
this
man
hath
for
a
few
light
crowns
lightly
conspird
and
sworn
unto
the
practices
of
france
to
kill
us
here
in
hampton
to
the
which
this
knight
no
less
for
bounty
bound
to
us
than
cambridge
is
hath
likewise
sworn
but
o
what
shall
i
say
to
thee
lord
scroop
thou
cruel
ingrateful
savage
and
inhuman
creature
thou
that
didst
bear
the
key
of
all
my
counsels
that
knewst
the
very
bottom
of
my
soul
that
almost
mightst
have
coind
me
into
gold
wouldst
thou
have
practisd
on
me
for
thy
use
may
it
be
possible
that
foreign
hire
could
out
of
thee
extract
one
spark
of
evil
that
might
annoy
my
finger
tis
so
strange
that
though
the
truth
of
it
stands
off
as
gross
as
black
and
white
my
eye
will
scarcely
see
it
treason
and
murder
ever
kept
together
as
two
yokedevils
sworn
to
eithers
purpose
working
so
grossly
in
a
natural
cause
that
admiration
did
not
whoop
at
them
but
thou
gainst
all
proportion
didst
bring
in
wonder
to
wait
on
treason
and
on
murder
and
whatsoever
cunning
fiend
it
was
that
wrought
upon
thee
so
preposterously
hath
got
the
voice
in
hell
for
excellence
and
other
devils
that
suggest
by
treasons
do
botch
and
bungle
up
damnation
with
patches
colours
and
with
forms
being
fetchd
from
glistring
semblances
of
piety
but
he
that
temperd
thee
bade
thee
stand
up
gave
thee
no
instance
why
thou
shouldst
do
treason
unless
to
dub
thee
with
the
name
of
traitor
if
that
same
demon
that
hath
gulld
thee
thus
should
with
his
lion
gait
walk
the
whole
world
he
might
return
to
vasty
tartar
back
and
tell
the
legions
i
can
never
win
a
soul
so
easy
as
that
englishmans
o
how
hast
thou
with
jealousy
infected
the
sweetness
of
affiance
show
men
dutiful
why
so
didst
thou
seem
they
grave
and
learned
why
so
didst
thou
come
they
of

the

the

french

thus
comes
the
english
with
full
power
upon
us
and
more
than
carefully
it
us
concerns
to
answer
royally
in
our
defences
therefore
the
dukes
of
berri
and
of
britaine
of
brabant
and
of
orleans
shall
make
forth
and
you
prince
dauphin

new
repair
our
towns
of

with
men
of
courage
and
with
means
defendant
for
england
his
approaches
makes
as
fierce
as
waters
to
the
sucking
of

it
fits
us
then
to
be
as
provident
as
fear
may
teach
us
out
of
late
examples
left
by
the
fatal
and
neglected
english
upon
our
fields
dauphin
my
most
redoubted
father
it
is
most
meet
we
arm
us
gainst
the
foe
for
peace
itself
should
not
so
dull
a
kingdom
though
war
nor
no
known
quarrel
were
in
question
but
that
defences
musters
preparations
should
be
maintaind
assembled
and
collected
as
were
a
war
in
expectation
therefore
i
say
tis
meet
we
all
go
forth
to
view
the
sick
and
feeble
parts
of
france
and
let
us
do
it
with
no
show
of
fear
no
with
no
more
than
if
we
heard
that
england
were
busied
with
a
whitsun
morrisdance
for
my
good
liege
she
is
so
idly
kingd
her
sceptre
so
fantastically
borne
by
a
vain
giddy
shallow
humorous
youth
that
fear
attends
her
not
constable
o
peace
prince
dauphin
you
are
too
much
mistaken
in
this
king
question
your
grace
the
late
ambassadors
with
what
great
state
he
heard
their
embassy
how
well
supplied
with
noble
counsellors
how
modest
in
exception
and
withal
how
terrible
in
constant
resolution
and
you
shall
find
his
vanities
forespent
were
but
the
outside
of
the
roman
brutus
covering
discretion
with
a
coat
of
folly
as
gardeners
do
with

hide
those
roots
that

first
spring

dauphin
well
tis
not
so
my
lord
high
constable
but
though
we
think
it
so
it
is
no
matter
in
cases
of
defence
tis
best
to
weigh
the
enemy
more
mighty
than
he
seems
so
the
proportions
of
defence
are
filld
which
of
a
weak
and
niggardly
projection
doth
like
a
miser
spoil
his
coat
with
scanting
a
little

french

think
we
king
harry
strong
and
princes
look
you
strongly
arm
to
meet
him
the
kindred
of
him
hath
been
fleshd
upon
us
and
he
is
bred
out
of
that
bloody
strain
that
haunted
us
in
our
familiar
paths
witness
our
too
much
memorable
shame
when
cressy
battle
fatally
was
struck
and
all
our
princes
capdvd
by
the
hand
of
that
black
name
edward
black
prince
of
wales
whiles
that
his
mountain
sire
on

standing
up
in

crownd
with
the
golden
sun
saw
his
heroical
seed

smild

see
him
mangle
the
work
of
nature
and
deface
the
patterns
that
by
god
and
by
french
fathers
had
twenty
years
been
made
this
is
a
stern
of
that
victorious
stock

the
native
mightiness
and
fate
of
him

almighty
that
you
divest
yourself
and
lay
apart
the
borrowed
glories
that
by
gift
of

all
widestretched
honours
that
pertain
by
custom
and
the
ordinance
of

unto
the
crown
of

that
you
may
know
tis
no
sinister
nor
no
awkward
claim

of
longvanishd
days
nor
from
the
dust
of
old
oblivion
rakd
he
sends
you
this
most
memorable
line






gives
a
paper
in
every
branch
truly
demonstrative
willing
you
overlook
this
pedigree
and
when
you
find
him
evenly
derivd
from
his
most
famd
of
famous
ancestors
edward

he
bids
you
then
resign
your

and

indirectly
held
from
him
the
native
and
true
challenger
french
king
or
else
what
follows
exeter
bloody
constraint
for
if
you
hide
the
crown
even
in
your
hearts
there
will
he
rake
for
it
therefore
in
fierce
tempest
is
he
coming
in
thunder
and
in
earthquake
like
a
jove
that
if
requiring
fail
he
will
compel
and
bids
you
in
the
bowels
of
the
lord
deliver
up
the
crown
and
to
take
mercy
on
the
poor
souls
for
whom
this
hungry
war
opens
his
vasty
jaws
and
on
your
head
turning
the
widows
tears
the
orphans
cries
the
dead
mens
blood
the
privy
maidens
groans
for
husbands
fathers
and
betrothed
lovers
that
shall
be
swallowed
in
this
controversy
this
is
his
claim
his
threatning
and
my
message
unless
the
dauphin
be
in

here
to
whom
expressly
i
bring

against

for
i
desire
nothing

as
we
his

have
in
wonder
found
between
the
promise
of
his
greener
days
and
these

now
now
he
weighs
time
even
to
the
utmost
grain
that

you

dispatchd
with
fair

once

unto
the
breach
dear
friends
once
more
or
close
the
wall
up
with
our
english
dead
in
peace
theres
nothing
so
becomes
a
man
as
modest
stillness
and
humility
but
when
the
blast
of
war
blows
in
our
ears
then
imitate
the
action
of
the
tiger
stiffen
the
sinews
summon
up
the
blood
disguise
fair
nature
with
hardfavourd
rage
then
lend
the
eye
a
terrible
aspect
let
it
pry
through
the
portage
of
the
head
like
the
brass
cannon
let
the
brow
oerwhelm
it
as
fearfully
as
doth
a
galled
rock
oerhang
and
jutty
his
confounded
base
swilld
with
the
wild
and
wasteful
ocean
now
set
the
teeth
and
stretch
the
nostril
wide
hold
hard
the
breath
and
bend
up
every
spirit
to
his
full
height
on
on
you
noblest
english
whose
blood
is
fet
from
fathers
of
warproof
fathers
that
like
so
many
alexanders
have
in
these
parts
from
morn
till
even
fought
and
sheathd
their
swords
for
lack
of
argument
dishonour
not
your
mothers
now
attest
that
those
whom
you
calld
fathers
did
beget
you
be
copy
now
to
men
of
grosser
blood
and
teach
them
how
to
war
and
you
good
yeomen
whose
limbs
were
made
in
england
show
us
here
the
mettle
of
your
pasture
let
us
swear
that
you
are
worth
your
breeding
which
i
doubt
not
for
there
is
none
of
you
so
mean
and
base
that
hath
not
noble
lustre
in
your
eyes
i
see
you
stand
like
greyhounds
in
the
slips
straining
upon
the
start
the

afoot
follow
your
spirit
and
upon
this

cry

boy
as
young
as
i
am
i
have
observd
these
three
swashers
i
am
boy
to
them
all
three
but
all
they
three
though
they
would
serve
me
could
not
be
man
to
me
for
indeed
three
such
antics
do
not
amount
to
a
man
for
bardolph
he
is
whiteliverd
and
redfacd
by
the
means
whereof
a
faces
it
out
but
fights
not
for
pistol
he
hath
a
killing
tongue
and
a
quiet
sword
by
the
means
whereof
a
breaks
words
and
keeps
whole
weapons
for
nym
he
hath
heard
that
men
of
few
words
are
the
best
men
and
therefore
he
scorns
to
say
his
prayers
lest
a
should
be
thought
a
coward
but
his
few
bad
words
are
matchd
with
as
few
good
deeds
for
a
never
broke
any
mans
head
but
his
own
and
that
was
against
a
post
when
he
was
drunk
they
will
steal
anything
and
call
it
purchase
bardolph
stole
a
lutecase
bore
it
twelve
leagues
and
sold
it
for
three
halfpence
nym
and
bardolph
are
sworn
brothers
in
filching
and
in
calais
they
stole
a
fireshovel
i
knew
by
that
piece
of
service
the
men
would
carry
coals
they
would
have
me
as
familiar
with
mens
pockets
as
their
gloves
or
their
handkerchers
which
makes
much
against
my
manhood
if
i
should
take
from
anothers
pocket
to
put
into
mine
for
it
is
plain
pocketing
up
of
wrongs
i
must
leave
them
and
seek
some
better
service
their
villainy
goes
against
my
weak
stomach
and
therefore
i
must
cast
it
up

the

this
is
the

we
will
admit
therefore
to
our
best
mercy
give
yourselves
or
like
to
men
proud
of
destruction
defy
us
to
our
worst
for
as
i
am
a
soldier
a
name
that
in
my
thoughts
becomes
me
best
if
i
begin
the
battry
once
again
i
will
not
leave
the
halfachieved
harfleur
till
in
her
ashes
she
lie
buried
the
gates
of
mercy
shall
be
all
shut
up
and
the
fleshd
soldier
rough
and
hard
of
heart
in
liberty
of
bloody
hand
shall
range
with
conscience
wide
as
hell
mowing
like

your
fresh
fair
virgins
and
your
flowring
infants
what
is

if
impious

of

do
with
his
smirchd
complexion
all
fell
feats
enlinkd
to
waste
and
desolation
what
ist
to
me
when
you
yourselves
are
cause
if
your
pure
maidens
fall
into
the
hand
of
hot

forcing
violation
what
rein
can
hold
licentious
wickednes
when
down

he
holds
his
fierce
career
we
may
as
bootless
spend
our
vain
command
upon
th
enraged
soldiers
in
their

as

therefore

pity
of
your

your

and
their

reverend
heads
dashd
to

your

spitted
upon

whiles
the

that
is
well
i
warrant
you
when

why
tis
a

a

a

that
now
and
then
goes
to
the
wars
to
grace
himself
at
his
return
into
london
under
the
form
of
a
soldier
and
such
fellows
are
perfect
in
the
great
commanders
names
and
they
will
learn
you
by
rote
where
services
were
done
at
such
and
such
a
sconce
at
such
a
breach
at
such
a
convoy
who
came
off
bravely
who
was
shot
who
disgracd
what
terms
the
enemy
stood
on
and
this
they
con
perfectly
in
the
phrase
of
war
which
they
trick
up
with
newtuned
oaths
and
what
a
beard
of
the
generals
cut
and
a
horrid
suit
of
the
camp
will
do
among
foaming
bottles
and
alewashd
wits
is
wonderful
to
be

you

sometimes
red

his

is
executed

his
fires
out
king
henry
we
would
have
all
such
offenders
so
cut
off

we
give
express
charge
that
in
our
marches
through
the
country
there
be
nothing
compelld
from
the
villages
nothing
taken
but
paid
for
none
of
the
french
upbraided
or
abused
in
disdainful

is
a
better
soldier
than
rashness
tell
him
we
could
have
rebukd
him
at
harfleur
but
that
we
thought
not
good
to
bruise
an
injury
till
it
were
full
ripe
now
we
speak
upon

cue
and
our
voice
is
imperial
england
shall
repent
his
folly
see
his
weakness
and
admire
our
sufferance
bid
him
therefore
consider
of
his
ransom
which
must
proportion
the
losses
we
have
borne
the
subjects
we
have
lost
the
disgrace
we
have
digested
which
in
weight
to
reanswer
his
pettiness
would
bow
under
for
our
losses
his
exchequer
is
too
poor
for
th
effusion
of
our
blood
the
muster
of
his
kingdom
too
faint
a
number
and
for
our
disgrace
his
own
person
kneeling
at
our
feet
but
a
weak
and
worthless
satisfaction
to
this
add
defiance
and
tell
him
for
conclusion
he
hath
betrayed
his
followers
whose
condemnation
is
pronouncd
so
far
my
king

so
much

montjoy
montjoy
king
henry
thou
dost
thy
office
fairly
turn
thee
back
and
tell
thy
king
i
do
not
seek
him
now
but
could
be
willing
to
march
on
to
calais
without
impeachment
for
to
say
the
sooth
though
tis
no
wisdom
to
confess
so
much
unto
an
enemy
of
craft
and
vantage
my
people
are
with
sickness
much
enfeebled
my
numbers
lessend
and
those
few
i
have
almost
no
better
than
so
many
french
who
when
they
were
in
health
i
tell
thee
herald
i
thought
upon
one
pair
of
english
legs
did
march
three
frenchmen
yet
forgive
me
god
that
i
do
brag
thus
this
your
air
of
france
hath
blown
that
vice
in
me
i
must
repent
go
therefore
tell
thy
master
here
i
am
my
ransom
is
this
frail
and
worthless
trunk
my
army
but
a
weak
and
sickly
guard
yet
god
before
tell
him
we
will
come
on
though
france
himself
and
such
another
neighbour
stand
in
our
way
theres
for
thy
labour
montjoy
go
bid
thy
master
well
advise
himself
if
we
may
pass
we
will
if
we
be
hindred
we
shall
your
tawny
ground
with
your
red
blood
discolour
and
so
montjoy
fare
you
well
the
sum
of
all
our
answer
is
but
this
we
would
not
seek
a
battle
as
we
are
nor
as
we
are
we
say
we
will
not
shun
it
so
tell
your
master
montjoy
i
shall
deliver
so
thanks
to
your
highness

would

alas
poor
harry

he
longs
not
for
the

as
we
do
orleans
what
a
wretched
and
peevish
fellow
is
this
king
of
england
to
mope
with
his
fatbraind
followers
so
far
out
of
his
knowledge
constable
if
the
english
had
any
apprehension
they
would
run
away
orleans
that
they
lack
for
if
their
heads
had
any
intellectual
armour
they
could
never
wear
such
heavy
headpieces
rambures
that
island
of

breeds
very
valiant
creatures
their
mastiffs
are
of
unmatchable
courage
orleans
foolish
curs
that
run
winking
into
the
mouth
of
a
russian
bear
and
have
their
heads
crushd
like
rotten
apples
you
may
as
well
say
thats
a
valiant
flea
that
dare
eat
his
breakfast
on
the
lip
of
a
lion
constable
just
just
and
the
men
do
sympathise
with
the
mastiffs
in
robustious
and
rough
coming
on
leaving
their
wits
with
their
wives
and
then
give
them
great
meals
of
beef
and
iron
and
steel
they
will
eat
like
wolves
and
fight
like
devils
orleans
ay
but
these
english
are
shrewdly
out
of
beef
constable
then
shall
we
find
tomorrow
they
have
only
stomachs
to
eat
and
none
to
fight
now
is
it
time
to
arm
come
shall
we
about
it
orleans
it
is
now
two
oclock
but
let

see
by

we
shall
have
each
a
hundred

find
the
ceremonies
of

wars
and
the
cares
of

and

and
the
sobriety

all

if
the

a

coxcomb

think
you
that

should
also
look
you
be
an
ass
and
a

and
a
prating
coxcomb
in
your

conscience

enter
three
soldiers
john
bates
alexander
court
and
michael
williams

court
brother
john
bates
is
not
that
the
morning
which
breaks
yonder
bates
i
think
it
be
but
we
have
no
great
cause
to
desire
the
approach
of
day
williams
we
see
yonder
the
beginning
of
the
day
but
i
think
we
shall
never
see
the
end
of
it
who
goes
there
king
henry
a
friend
williams
under
what
captain
serve
you
king
henry
under
sir
thomas
erpingham
williams
a
good
old
commander
and
a
most
kind
gentleman
i
pray
you
what
thinks
he
of
our
estate
king
henry
even
as
men
wreckd
upon
a
sand
that
look
to
be
washd
off
the
next
tide
bates
he
hath
not
told
his
thought
to
the
king
king
henry
no
nor
it
is
not
meet
he
should
for
though
i
speak
it
to
you
i
think
the
king
is
but
a
man
as
i
am
the
violet
smells
to
him
as
it
doth
to
me
the
element
shows
to
him
as
it
doth
to
me
all
his
senses
have
but
human
conditions
his
ceremonies
laid
by
in
his
nakedness
he
appears
but
a
man
and
though
his
affections
are
higher
mounted
than
ours
yet
when
they
stoop
they
stoop
with
the
like
wing
therefore
when
he
sees
reason
of
fears
as
we
do
his
fears
out
of
doubt
be
of
the
same
relish
as
ours
are
yet
in
reason
no
man
should
possess
him
with
any
appearance
of
fear
lest
he
by
showing
it
should
dishearten
his
army
bates
he
may
show
what
outward
courage
he
will
but
i
believe
as
cold
a
night
as
tis
he
could
wish
himself
in
thames
up
to
the
neck
and
so
i
would
he
were
and
i
by
him
at
all
adventures
so
we
were
quit
here
king
henry
by
my
troth
i
will
speak
my
conscience
of
the
king
i
think
he
would
not
wish
himself
anywhere
but
where
he
is
bates
then
i
would
he
were
here
alone
so
should
he
be
sure
to
be
ransomed
and
a
many
poor
mens
lives
saved
king
henry
i
dare
say
you
love
him
not
so
ill
to
wish
him
here
alone
howsoever
you
speak
this
to
feel
other
mens
minds
methinks
i
could
not
die
anywhere
so
contented
as
in
the
kings
company
his
cause
being
just
and
his
quarrel
honourable
williams
thats
more
than
we
know
bates
ay
or
more
than
we
should
seek
after
for
we
know
enough
if
we
know
we
are
the
kings
subjects
if
his
cause
be
wrong
our
obedience
to
the
king
wipes
the
crime
of
it
out
of
us
williams
but
if
the
cause
be
not
good
the
king
himself
hath
a
heavy
reckoning
to
make
when
all
those
legs
and
arms
and
heads
choppd
off
in
a
battle
shall
join
together
at
the
latter
day
and
cry
all
we
died
at
such
a
place
some
swearing
some
crying
for
a
surgeon
some
upon
their
wives
left
poor
behind
them
some
upon
the
debts
they
owe
some
upon
their
children
rawly
left
i
am
afeard
there
are
few
die
well
that
die
in
a
battle
for
how
can
they
charitably
dispose
of
anything
when
blood
is
their
argument
now
if
these
men
do
not
die
well
it
will
be
a
black
matter
for
the
king
that
led
them
to
it
who
to
disobey
were
against
all
proportion
of
subjection
king
henry
so
if
a
son
that
is
by
his
father
sent
about
merchandise
do
sinfully
miscarry
upon
the
sea
the
imputation
of
his
wickedness
by
your
rule
should
be
imposed
upon
his
father
that
sent
him
or
if
a
servant
under
his
masters
command
transporting
a
sum
of
money
be
assailed
by
robbers
and
die
in
many
irreconcild
iniquities
you
may
call
the
business
of
the
master
the
author
of
the
servants
damnation
but
this
is
not
so
the
king
is
not
bound
to
answer
the
particular
endings
of
his
soldiers
the
father
of
his
son
nor
the
master
of
his
servant
for
they
purpose
not
their
death
when
they
purpose
their
services
besides
there
is
no
king
be
his
cause
never
so
spotless
if
it
come
to
the
arbitrement
of
swords
can
try
it
out
with
all
unspotted
soldiers
some
peradventure
have
on
them
the
guilt
of
premeditated
and
contrived
murder
some
of
beguiling
virgins
with
the
broken
seals
of
perjury
some
making
the
wars
their
bulwark
that
have
before
gored
the
gentle
bosom
of
peace
with
pillage
and
robbery
now
if
these
men
have
defeated
the
law
and
outrun
native
punishment
though
they
can
outstrip
men
they
have
no
wings
to
fly
from
god
war
is
his
beadle
war
is
his
vengeance
so
that
here
men
are
punishd
for
beforebreach
of
the
kings
laws
in
now
the
kings
quarrel
where
they
feared
the
death
they
have
borne
life
away
and
where
they
would
be
safe
they
perish
then
if
they
die
unprovided
no
more
is
the
king
guilty
of
their
damnation
than
he
was
before
guilty
of
those
impieties
for
the
which
they
are
now
visited
every
subjects
duty
is
the
kings
but
every
subjects
soul
is
his
own
therefore
should
every
soldier
in
the
wars
do
as
every
sick
man
in
his
bed
wash
every
mote
out
of
his
conscience
and
dying
so
death
is
to
him
advantage
or
not
dying
the
time
was
blessedly
lost
wherein
such
preparation
was
gained
and
in
him
that
escapes
it
were
not
sin
to
think
that
making
god
so
free
an
offer
he
let
him
outlive
that
day
to
see
his
greatness
and
to
teach
others
how
they
should
prepare
williams
tis
certain
every
man
that
dies
ill
the
ill
upon
his
own
head
the
king
is
not
to
answer
for
it
bates
i
do
not
desire
he
should
answer
for
me
and
yet
i
determine
to
fight
lustily
for
him
king
henry
i
myself
heard
the

that
his

desire
him
to
have
borne
his
bruised
helmet

his

sword
before
him
through

forbids
it
being
free
from
vainness
and
selfglorious
pride
giving
full
trophy
signal
and
ostent
quite
from

how
london
doth
pour
out
her

congreeted
let
it
not
disgrace
me
if
i
demand
before
this
royal
view
what
rub
or
what
impediment
there
is
why
that
the
naked
poor
and
mangled
peace
dear
nurse
of
arts
plenties
and
joyful
births
should
not
in
this
best
garden
of
the
world
our
fertile
france
put
up
her
lovely
visage
alas
she
hath
from
france
too
long
been
chasd
and
all
her
husbandry
doth
lie
on
heaps
corrupting
in
it
own
fertility
her
vine
the
merry
cheerer
of
the
heart
unpruned
dies
her
hedges
evenpleachd
like
prisoners
wildly
overgrown
with
hair
put
forth
disorderd
twigs
her
fallow
leas
the
darnel
hemlock
and
rank
fumitory
doth
root
upon
while
that
the
coulter
rusts
that
should
deracinate
such
savagery
the
even
mead
that
erst
brought
sweetly
forth
the
freckled
cowslip
burnet
and
green
clover
wanting
the
scythe
all
uncorrected
rank
conceives
by
idleness
and
nothing
teems
but
hateful
docks
rough
thistles
kecksies
burs
losing
both
beauty
and
utility
and
as
our
vineyards
fallows
meads
and
hedges
defective
in
their
natures
grow
to
wildness
even
so
our
houses
and
ourselves
and
children
have
lost
or
do
not
learn
for
want
of
time
the
sciences
that
should
become
our
country
but
grow
like
savages
as
soldiers
will
that
nothing
do
but
meditate
on
blood
to
swearing
and
stern
looks
diffusd
attire
and
everything
that
seems
unnatural
which

reduce
into
our
former
favout

thou
wouldst
find

a
plain
king
that
thou
wouldst
think
i
had
sold
my
farm
to
buy
my
crown
i
know
no
ways
to
mince
it
in
love
but
directly
to
say
i
love
you
then
if
you
urge
me
farther
than
to
say
do
you
in
faith
i
wear
out

suit

me
understand
well
king
henry
marry
if
you
would
put
me
to
verses
or
to
dance
for
your
sake
kate
why
you
undid
me
for
the
one
i
have
neither
words
nor
measure
and
for
the
other
i
have
no
strength
in
measure
yet
a
reasonable
measure
in
strength
if
i
could
win
a
lady
at
leapfrog
or
by
vaulting
into
my
saddle
with
my
armour
on
my
back
under
the
correction
of
bragging
be
it
spoken
i
should
quickly
leap
into
wife
or
if
i
might
buffet
for
my
love
or
bound
my
horse
for
her
favours
i
could
lay
on
like
a
butcher
and
sit
like
a
jackanapes
never
off
but
before
god
kate
i
cannot
look
greenly
nor
gasp
out
my
cloquence
nor
i
have
no
cunning
in
protestation
only
downright
oaths
which
i
never
use
till
urgd
nor
never
break
for
urging
if
thou
canst
love
a
fellow
of
this
temper
kate
whose
face
is
not
worth
sunburning
that
never
looks
in
his
glass
for
love
of
anything
he
sees
there
let
thine
eye
be
thy
cook
i
speak
to
thee
plain
soldier
if
thou
canst
love
me
for
this
take
me
if
not
to
say
to
thee
that
i
shall
die
is
true
but
for
thy
love
by
the
lord
no
yet
i
love
thee
too
and
while
thou
livst
dear
kate
take
a
fellow
of
plain
and
uncoined
constancy
for
he
perforce
must
do
thee
right
because
he
hath
not
the
gift
to
woo
in
other
places
for
these
fellows
of
infinite
tongue
that
can
rhyme
themselves
into
ladies
favours
they
do
always
reason
themselves
out
again
what
a
speaker
is
but
a
prater
a
rhyme
is
but
a
ballad
a
good
leg
will
fall
a
straight
back
will
stoop
a
black
beard
will
turn
white
a
curld
pate
will
grow
bald
a
fair
face
will
wither
a
full
eye
will
wax
hollow
but
a
good
heart
kate
is
the
sun
and
the
moon
or
rather
the
sun
and
not
the
moon
for
it
shines
bright
and
never
changes
but
keeps
his
course
truly
if
thou
would
have
such
a
one
take
me
and
take
me
take
a
soldier
take
a
soldier
take
a
king
and
what
sayst
thou
then
to
my
love
speak
my
fair
and
fairly
i
pray
thee
katherine
is
it
possible
dat
i
sould
love
de
enemy
of
france
king
henry
no
it
is
not
possible
you
should
love
the
enemy
of
france
kate
but
in
loving
me
you
should
love
the
friend
of
france
for
i
love
france
so
well
that
i
will
not
part
with
a
village
of
it
i
will
have
it
all
mine

kate
when

tell
vat
is
dat
king
henry
no
kate
i
will
tell
thee
in
french
which
i
am
sure
will
hang
upon
my
tongue
like
a
newmarried
wife
about
her
husbands
neck
hardly
to
be
shook
off

it
is
as
easy
for
me
kate
to
conquer
the
kingdom
as
to
speak
so
much
more
french
i
shall
never
move
thee
in
french
unless
it
be
to
laugh
at
me
katherine

parle
king
henry
no
faith

not
kate
but
thy
speaking
of
my
tongue

thine
most
truly
falsely

this
gentlewoman
about
me

you
will
to
her
dispraise
those
parts
in
me
that
you
love
with
your
heart
but
good
kate
mock
me
mercifully
the
rather
gentle
princess
because

love
thee
cruelly
if

beest
mine
kate
as
i
have
a
saving
faith
within
me
tells
me

king
henry
it
is
not
a
fashion
for
the
maids
in

to

before
they
are
married
would
she
say
alice
oui
vraiment
king
henry
o
kate
nice
customs
curtsy
to
great
kings
dear
kate
you
and
i
cannot
be
confind
within
the
weak
list
of
a
countrys
fashion
we
are
the
makers
of
manners
kate
and
the
liberty
that
follows
our
places
stops
the
mouth
of
all
findfaults
as
i
will
do
yours
for
upholding
the
nice
fashion
of
your
country
in
denying
me
a
kiss
therefore
patiently
and
yielding

kissing
her

you
have
witchcraft
in
your
lips
kate
there
is
more
eloquence
in
a
sugar
touch
of
them
than
in
the
tongues
of
the
french
council
and
they
should
sooner
persuade
henry
of
england
than
a
general
petition
of
monarchs
here
comes
your
father

enter
the
french
power
and
the
english
lords

burgundy
god
save
your
majesty
my
royal
cousin
teach
you
our
princess
english
king
henry
i
would
have
her
learn
my
fair
cousin
how
perfectly
i
love
her
and
that
is
good
english
burgundy
is
she
not
apt
king
henry
our
tongue
is
rough
coz
and
my
condition
is
not
smooth
so
that
having
neither
the
voice
nor
the
heart
of
flattery
about
me
i
cannot
so
conjure
up
the
spirit
of
love
in
her
that
he
will
appear
in
his
true
likeness
burgundy
pardon
the
frankness
of
my
mirth
if
i
answer
you
for
that
if
you
would
conjure
in
her
you
must
make
a
circle
if
conjure
up
love
in
her
in
his
true
likeness
he
must
appear
naked
and
blind
can
you
blame
her
then
being
a
maid
yet
rosd
over
with
the
virgin
crimson
of
modesty
if
she
deny
the
appearance
of
a
naked
blind
boy
in
her
naked
seeing
self
it
were
my
lord
a
hard
condition
for
a
maid
to
consign
to
king
henry
yet
they
do
wink
and
yield
as
love
is
blind
and
enforces
burgundy
they
are
then
excusd
my
lord
when
they
see
not
what
they
do
king
henry
then
good
my
lord
teach
your
cousin
to
consent
winking
burgundy
i
will
wink
on
her
to
consent
my
lord
if
you
will
teach
her
to
know
my
meaning
for
maids
well
summerd
and
warm
kept
are
like
flies
at
bartholomewtide
blind
though
they
have
their
eyes
and
then
they
will
endure
handling
which
before
would
not
abide
looking
on
king
henry
this
moral
ties
me
over
to
time
and
a
hot
summer
and
so
i
shall
catch
the
fly
your
cousin
in
the
latter
end
and
she
must
be
blind
too
burgundy
as
love
is
my
lord
before
it
loves
king
henry
it
is
so
and
you
may
some
of
you
thank
love
for
my
blindness
who
cannot
see
many
a
fair
french
city
for
one
fair
french
maid
that
stands
in
my
way
french
king
yes
my
lord
you
see
them
perspectively
the
cities
turned
into
a
maid
for
they
are
all
girdled
with
maiden
walls
that
war
hath
never
entred
king
henry
shall
kate
be
my
wife
french
king
so
please
you
king
henry
i
am
content
so
the
maiden
cities
you
talk
of
may
wait
on
her
so
the
maid
that
stood
in
the
way
for
my
wish
shall
show
me
the
way
to
my
will
french
king
we
have
consented
to
all
terms
of
reason
king
henry
ist
so
my
lords
of
england
westmoreland
the
king
hath
granted
every
article
his
daughter
first
and
then
in
sequel
all
according
to
their
firm
proposed
natures
exeter
only
he
hath
not
yet
subscribed
this
where
your

plantagenet
tut

here
is

the

so
naked
on

that
any

may
find
it
out
somerset
and
on

it
is
so
well

clear
so
shining

so
evident
that
it

glimmer
through
a
blind

him
that

dare
maintain
the
party
of
the

pluck
a

from
off
this

i
love
no
colours
and
without
all
colour
of

withal
i

he
held
the

and
pluck
no
more
till
you
conclude
that
he
upon

the
fewest
roses
are
croppd
from
the
tree
shall
yield
the

in
the
right
opinion
somerset
good

it
is
well
objected
if
i
have
fewest
i

this

grown

burns
under

will
at

break
out

by

till

fall

so
will
this

breed

i
fear
that
fatal
prophecy
which
in

of
henry
namd

was
in
the
mouth
of
every
sucking
babe
that
henry
born

should

is
so
plain

who

with
a

from

shame
to
the

and
thee
i
vowd
base
knight
when
i
did
meet
thee
next
to
tear
the
garter
from
thy
cravens
leg

plucking
it
off
which
i
have
done
because
unworthily
thou
wast
installed
in
that
high
degree
pardon
me
princely
henry
and
the
rest
this
dastard
at
the
battle
of
patay
when
but
in
all
i
was
six
thousand
strong
and
that
the
french
were
almost
ten
to
one
before
we
met
or
that
a
stroke
was
given
like
to
a
trusty
squire
did
run
away
in
which
assault
we
lost
twelve
hundred
men
myself
and
divers
gentlemen
beside
were
there
surprisd
and
taken
prisoners
then
judge
great
lords
if
i
have
done
amiss
or
whether
that
such
cowards
ought
to
wear
this
ornament
of
knighthoodyea
or
no
gloucester
to
say
the
truth
this
fact
was
infamous
and
ill
beseeming
any
common
man
much
more
a
knight
a
captain
and
a
leader
talbot
when
first
this
order
was
ordaind
my
lords
knights
of
the
garter
were
of
noble
birth
valiant
and
virtuous
full
of
haughty
courage
such
as
were
grown
to
credit
by
the
wars
not
fearing
death
nor
shrinking
for
distress
but
always
resolute
in
most
extremes
he
then
that
is
not
furnishd
in
this
sort
doth
but
usurp
the
sacred
name
of
knight
profaning
this
most
honourable
order
and
should
if
i
were
worthy
to
be
judge
be
quite
degraded

a
hedgeborn
swain
that
doth
presume
to
boast
of
gentle
blood

henry

to
thy

thou

what
means
his
grace
that
he
hath
changd
his
style
no
more
but
plain
and
bluntly
to
the
king
hath
he
forgot
he
is
his

doth
this
churlish

pretend
some
alteration
in

whats
here

reads

i

with
compassion
of
my

wreck
together
with

of
such
as
your
oppression
feeds
upon
forsaken
your
pernicious
faction
and
joind
with
charles
the
rightful
king
of

o
monstrous
treachery
can
this
be
so
that
in

amity

there
should

such
false
dissembling
guile

my

worst
this

is
the

i
crave
the

that

for
though
he
seem
with
forged
quaint
conceit
to
set
a
gloss
upon
his
bold
intent
yet
know
my
lord
i
was
provokd
by
him
and
he
first
took
exceptions
at
this
badge
pronouncing
that
the

of
this

bewrayd
the
faintness
of
my
masters

not

malice
somerset
be
left
somerset
your

my
lord
of

will
out
though
neer
so
cunningly
you
smother
it
king
henry
good
lord
what
madness
rules
in
brainsick
men
when
for
so
slight
and
frivolous
a
cause
such
factious
emulations
shall
arise
good
cousins
both
of
york
and
somerset
quiet
yourselves
i
pray
and
be
at
peace
york
let
this
dissension
first
be
tried
by
fight
and
then
your
highness
shall
command
a
peace
somerset
the
quarrel
toucheth
none
but
us
alone
betwixt
ourselves
let
us
decide
it
then
york
there
is
my
pledge
accept
it
somerset
vernon
nay
let
it
rest
where
it
began
at
first
basset
confirm
it
so
mine
honourable
lord
gloucester
confirm
it
so
confounded
be
your
strife
and
perish
ye
with
your
audacious
prate
presumptuous
vassals
are
you
not
ashamd
with
this
immodest
clamorous
outrage
to
trouble
and
disturb
the
king
and
us
and
you
my
lords
methinks
you
do
not
well
to
bear
with
their
perverse
objections
much
less
to
take
occasion
from
their
mouths
to
raise
a
mutiny
betwixt
yourselves
let
me
persuade
you
take
a
better
course
exeter
it
grieves
his
highness
good
my
lords
be
friends
king
henry
come
hither
you
that
would
be
combatants
henceforth
i
charge
you
as
you
love
our
favour
quite
to
forget
this
quarrel
and
the
cause
and
you
my
lords
remember
where
we
are
in
france
amongst
a
fickle
wavering
nation
if
they
perceive
dissension
in
our
looks
and
that
within
ourselves
we
disagree
how
will
their
grudging
stomachs
be
provokd
to
wilful
disobedience
and
rebel
beside
what
infamy
will
there
arise
when
foreign
princes
shall
be
certified
that
for
a
toy
a
thing
of
no
regard
king
henrys
peers
and
chief
nobility
destroyd
themselves
and
lost
the
realm
of
france
o
think
upon
the
conquest
of
my
father
my
tender
years
and
let
us
not
forgo
that
for
a
trifle
that
was
bought
with
blood
let
me
be
umpire
in
this
doubtful
strife
i
see
no
reason
if
i
wear
this
rose
putting
on
a
red
rose
that
any
one
should
therefore
be
suspicious
i
more
incline
to
somerset
than
york
both
are
my
kinsmen
and
i
love
them
both
as
well
they
may
upbraid
me
with
my
crown
because
forsooth
the
king
of
scots
is
crownd
but
your
discretions
better
can
persuade
than
i
am
able
to
instruct
or
teach
and
therefore
as
we
hither
came
in
peace
so
let
us
still
continue
peace
and
love
cousin
of
york

and

a

that
you

ill

tush
thats

carpenter
suffolk

aside

yet
so
my
fancy
may
be
satisfied
and
peace
established
between
these

but
there
remains
a
scruple
in
that
too
for
though
her
father
be
the
king
of
naples
duke
of
anjou
and
maine
yet
is
he
poor
and
our

will
scorn

perhaps
i

not
crave
his
courtesy
suffolk
sweet

give
me
hearing

you
not
suppose
your

happy
to

margaret
to

servility

this

either
accept

thou

to

my

you

to

to
say
the

it

your
policy
to
save
your
subjects
from
such
massacre
and
ruthless
slaughters
as
are
daily
seen
by

and
therefore
take
this
compact
of
a

although
you
break
it
when

how
sayst
thou

our

it

your

either
to
suffer
shipwreck
or
arrive
where
i
may
have
fruition
of
her
love
suffolk
tush
my
good
lord
this
superficial
tale
is
but
a
preface
of
her
worthy
praise
the
chief
perfections
of
that
lovely
dame
had
i
sufficient
skill
to
utter
them
would
make
a
volume
of
enticing
lines
able
to
ravish
any
dull
conceit
and
which
is
more
she
is
not
so
divine
so
fullreplete
with
choice
of
all
delights
but
with
as
humble
lowliness
of
mind
she
is
content
to
be
at
your
command
command
i
mean
of
virtuous
intents
to
love
and
honour
henry
as
her
lord
king
henry
and
otherwise
will
henry
neer
presume
therefore
my
lord
protector
give
consent
that
margaret
may
be
englands
royal
queen
gloucester
so
should
i
give
consent
to
flatter
sin
you
know
my
lord
your
highness
is
betrothd
unto
another
lady
of
esteem
how
shall
we
then
dispense
with
that
contract
and
not
deface
your
honour
with
reproach
suffolk
as
doth
a
ruler
with
unlawful
oaths
or
one
that
at
a
triumph
having
vowd
to
try
his
strength
forsaketh
yet
the
lists
by
reason
of
his
adversarys
odds
a
poor
earls
daughter
is
unequal
odds
and
therefore
may
be
broke
without
offence
gloucester
why
what
i
pray
is
margaret
more
than
that
her
father
is
no
better
than
an
earl
although
in
glorious
titles
he
excel
suffolk
yes
my
lord
her
father
is
a
king
the
king
of
naples
and
jerusalem
and
of
such
great
authority
in
france
as
his
alliance
will
confirm
our
peace
and
keep
the
frenchmen
in
allegiance
gloucester
and
so
the
earl
of
armagnac
may
do
because
he
is
near
kinsman
unto
charles
exeter
beside
his
wealth
doth
warrant
a
liberal
dower
where
reignier
sooner
will
receive
than
give
suffolk
a
dowr
my
lords
disgrace
not
so
your
king
that
he
should
be
so
abject
base
and
poor
to
choose
for
wealth
and
not
for
perfect
love
henry
is
able
to
enrich
his
queen
and
not
to
seek
a
queen
to
make
him
rich
so
worthless
peasants
bargain
for
their
wives
as
marketmen
for
oxen
sheep
or
horse
marriage
is
a
matter
of
more
worth
than
to
be
dealt
in
by
attorneyship
not
whom
we
will
but
whom
his
grace
affects
must
be
companion
of
his
nuptial
bed
and
therefore
lords
since
he
affects
her
most
it
most
of
all
these
reasons
bindeth
us
in
our
opinions
she
should
be
preferrd
for
what
is
wedlock
forced
but
a
hell
an
age
of
discord
and
continual
strife
whereas
the
contrary
bringeth
bliss
and
is
a
pattern
of
celestial
peace
whom
should
we
match
with
henry
being
a
king
but
margaret
that
is
daughter
to
a
king
her
peerless
feature
joined
with
her
birth
approves
her
fit
for
none
but
for
a
king
her
valiant
courage
and
undaunted
spirit
more
than
in
women
commonly
is
seen
will
answer
our
hope
in
issue
of
a
king
for
henry
son
unto
a
conqueror
is
likely
to
beget
more
conquerors
if
with
a
lady
of
so
high
resolve
as
is
fair
margaret
he

linkd
in

then
yield
my
lords
and
here
conclude
with
me
that

none

henry
whether
it

was
never

in

did
he
so
often
lodge
in

have

or
hath

and
myself
with
all
the
learned
council
of
the
realm
studied
so
long
sat
in
the
council
house
early
and
late
debating
to
and
fro
how
france
and
frenchmen
might
be
kept
in
awe
and
had
his
highness
in
his
infancy
crowned
in
paris
in
despite
of
foes
and
shall
these
labours

these
honours
die
shall
henrys
conquest
bedfords
vigilance
your
deeds
of
war
and
all
our
counsel
die
o
peers
of
england
shameful
is
this
league
fatal
this
marriage
cancelling
your
fame
blotting
your
names
from
books
of
memory
razing
the
characters
of
your
renown
defacing
monuments
of
conquerd
france
undoing
all
as
all
had
never
been
cardinal
nephew
what
means
this
passionate
discourse
this
peroration
with
such
circumstance
for
france
tis
ours
and
we
will
keep
it
still
gloucester
ay
uncle
we
will
keep
it
if
we
can
but
now
it
is
impossible
we
should
suffolk
the
newmade
duke
that
rules
the
roast
hath
given
the
duchy
of
anjou
and
maine
unto
the
poor
king
reignier
whose
large
style
agrees
not
with
the
leanness
of
his
purse
salisbury
now
by
the
death
of
him
that
died
for
all
these
counties
were
the
keys
of
normandy
but
wherefore
weeps
warwick
my
valiant
son
warwick
for
grief
that
they
are
past
recovery
for
were
there
hope
to
conquer
them
again
my
sword
should
shed
hot
blood
mine
eyes
no
tears
anjou
and
maine
myself
did
win
them
both
those
provinces
these
arms
of
mine
did
conquer
and
are
the
cities
that
i
got
with
wounds
deliverd
up
again
with
peaceful
words
mort
dieu
york
for
suffolks
duke
may
he
be
suffocate
that
dims
the
honour
of
this
warlike
isle
france
should
have
torn
and
rent
my
very
heart
before
i
would
have
yielded
to
this
league
i
never
read
but
englands
kings
have
had
large
sums
of
gold
and
dowries
with
their
wives
and
our
king
henry
gives
away
his
own
to
match
with
her
that
brings
no
vantages
gloucester
a
proper
jest
and
never
heard
before
that
suffolk
should
demand
a
whole
fifteenth
for
costs
and
charges
in
transporting
her
she
should
have
stayd
in
france
and
starvd
in
france
before
cardinal
my
lord
of
gloucester
now
ye
grow
too
hot
it
was
the
pleasure
of
my
lord
the
king
gloucester
my
lord
of
winchester
i
know
your
mind
tis
not
my
speeches
that
you
do
mislike

tis
my
presence
that
doth
trouble
ye
rancour
will
out

prelate
in

if

is
mine
enemy
nay
more
an
enemy
unto
you
all
and
no
great
friend
i
fear
me
to
the
king
consider
lords
he
is
the
next
of
blood
and
heir
apparent
to
the
english
crown
had
henry
got
an
empire
by
his
marriage
and
all
the
wealthy
kingdoms
of
the
west
theres
reason
he
should
be
displeasd
at
it
look
to
it
lords
let
not
his
smoothing
words
bewitch
your
hearts
be
wise
and
circumspect
what
though
the
common
people
favour
him
calling
him
humphrey
the
good
duke
of
gloucester
clapping
their
hands
and
crying
with
loud
voice
jesu
maintain
your
royal
excellence
with
god
preserve
the
good
duke
humphrey
i
fear
me
lords
for
all
this
flattering
gloss
he
will
be
found
a
dangerous
protector
buckingham
why
should
he
then
protect
our
sovereign
he
being
of
age
to
govern
of
himself
cousin
of
somerset
join
you
with

and
all
together

weighty
business

somerset
cousin
of
buckingham
though
humphreys
pride
and
greatness
of
his
place
be
grief
to
us
yet
let
us
watch
the
haughty
cardinal
his
insolence
is
more
intolerable
than
all
the
princes
in
the
land
beside
if
gloucester
be
displacd
hell
be
protector
buckingham
or
thou
or
i

went
before
ambition
follows
him
while
these
do
labour
for
their
own
preferment
behoves
it
us
to
labour
for
the
realm
i
never
saw
but
humphrey
duke
of
gloucester
did
bear
him
like
a
noble
gentleman
oft
have
i
seen
the
haughty
cardinal
more
like
a
soldier
than
a
man
o
th
church
as
stout
and
proud
as
he
were
lord
of
all
swear
like
a
ruffian
and
demean
himself
unlike
the
ruler
of
a
commonweal
warwick
my
son
the
comfort
of
my
age
thy
deeds
thy
plainness
and
thy
housekeeping
hath
won
the
greatest
favour
of
the
commons
excepting
none
but
good
duke
humphrey
and
brother
york
thy
acts
in
ireland
in
bringing
them
to
civil
discipline
thy
late
exploits
done
in
the
heart
of
france
when
thou
wert
regent
for
our
sovereign
have
made
thee
feard
and
honourd
of
the
people
join
we
together
for
the
public
good
in
what
we
can
to
bridle
and
suppress
the
pride
of
suffolk
and
the
cardinal
with
somersets
and
buckinghams
ambition
and
as
we
may
cherish
duke
humphreys
deeds
while
they
do
tend
the
profit
of
the
land
warwick
so
god
help
warwick
as
he
loves
the
land
and
common
profit
of
his
country
york
and
so
says
york
aside
for
he
hath
greatest
cause
salisbury
then
lets
make
haste
away
and
look
unto
the
main
warwick
unto
the
main
o
father
maine
is
lost
that
maine
which
by
main
force
warwick
did
win
and
would
have
kept
so
long
as
breath
did
last
main
chance
father
you
meant
but
i
meant
maine
which
i
will
win
from
france
or
else
be
slain
exeunt
warwick
and
salisbury
york
anjou
and
maine
are
given
to
the
french
paris
is
lost
the
state
of
normandy
stands
on
a
tickle
point
now
they
are
gone
suffolk
concluded
on
the
articles
the
peers
agreed
and
henry
was
well
pleasd
to
changes
two
dukedoms
for
a
dukes
fair
daughter
i
cannot
blame
them
all
what
ist
to
them
tis
thine
they
give
away
and
not
their
own
pirates
may
make
cheap
pennyworths
of
their
pillage
and
purchase
friends
and
give
to
courtezans
still
revelling
like
lords
till
all
be
gone
while
as
the
silly
owner
of
the
goods
weeps
over
them
and
wrings
his
hapless
hands
and
shakes
his
head
and
trembling
stands
aloof
while
all
is
shard
and
all
is
borne
away
ready
to
starve
and
dare
not
touch
his
own
so
york
must
sit
and
fret
and
bite
his
tongue
while
his
own
lands
are
bargaind
for
and
sold
methinks
the
realms
of
england
france
and
ireland
bear
that
proportion
to
my
flesh
and
blood
as
did
the
fatal
brand
althaea
burnt
unto
the
princes
heart
of
calydon
anjou
and
maine
both
given
unto
the
french
cold
news
for
me
for
i
had
hope
of
france
even
as
i
have
of
fertile
englands
soil
a
day
will
come
when
york
shall
claim
his
own
and
therefore
i
will
take
the
nevils
parts
and
make
a
show
of
love
to
proud
duke
humphrey
and
when
i
spy
advantage
claim
the
crown
for
thats
the
golden
mark
i
seek
to
hit
nor
shall
proud
lancaster
usurp
my
right
nor
hold
the
sceptre
in
his
childish
fist
nor
wear
the
diadem
upon
his
head
whose
churchlike
humours
fits
not
for
a
crown
then
york
be
still
awhile
till
time
do
serve
watch
thou
and
wake
when
others
be
asleep
to
pry
into
the
secrets
of
the

till
henry
surfeiting

of
love
with
his

this
the
fashions
in
the
court
of
england
is
this
the
government
of
britains
isle
and
this
the
royalty
of
albions
king
what
shall
king
henry
be
a
pupil
still
under
the
surly
gloucesters
governance
am
i
a
queen
in
title
and
in
style
and
must
be
made
a
subject
to
a
duke
i
tell
thee
pole
when
in
the
city
tours
thou
ranst
a
tilt
in
honour
of
my
love
and
stolst
away
the
ladies
hearts
of
france
i
thought
king
henry
had
resembled
thee
in
courage
courtship
and
proportion
but
all
his
mind
is
bent
to
holiness
to
number
avemaries
on
his
beads
his
champions
are
the
prophets
and
apostles
his
weapons
holy
saws
of
sacred
writ
his
study
is
his
tiltyard
and
his
loves
are
brazen
images
of
canonized
saints
i
would
the
college
of
the
cardinals
would
choose
him
pope
and
carry
him
to
rome
and
set
the
triple
crown
upon
his
head
that
were
a
state
fit
for
his
holiness
suffolk
madam
be
patient
as
i
was
cause
your
highness
came
to
england
so
will
i
in
england
work
your

full
content
queen
beside
the
haughty
protector
have
we
beaufort
the
imperious
churchman
somerset
buckingham
and
grumbling
york
and
not
the
least
of
these
but
can
do
more
in
england
than
the
king
suffolk
and
he
of
these
that
can
do
most
of
all
cannot
do
more
in
england
than
the
nevils
salisbury
and
warwick
are
no
simple
peers
queen
not
all
these
lords
do
vex
me
half
so
much
as
that
proud
dame
the
lord
protectors
wife
she
sweeps
it
through
the
court
with
troops
of
ladies
more
like
an
empress
than
duke
humphreys
wife
strangers
in

do
take
her
for
the
queen
she
bears
a
dukes
revenues
on
her
back

in

heart
she
scorns
our
poverty
shall
i
not
live

be
avengd
on
her
contemptuous
baseborn
callet
as
she
is
she
vaunted
mongst
her
minions
t
other
day
the
very
train
of
her
worst
wearing
gown
was
better
worth
than
all
my
fathers
lands
till
suffolk
gave
two
dukedoms
for
his
daughter
suffolk
madam
myself
have
limd
a
bush
for
her

of
such
enticing
birds
that
she
will
light
to
listen
to
the
lays
and
never
mount
to
trouble
you
again
so
let
her
rest
and
madam
list
to
me
for
i
am
bold
to
counsel
you
in
this
although
we
fancy
not
the
cardinal
yet
must
we
join
with
him
and
with
the
lords
till
we
have
brought
duke
humphrey
in
disgrace
as
for
the
duke
of

this
late

but
little
for

for

i
muse
my
lord
of
gloucester
is
not
come
tis
not
his
wont
to
be
the
hindmost
man
whateer
occasion
keeps
him
from
us
now
queen
can
you
not
see
or
will
ye
not
observe
the
strangeness
of
his
alterd
countenance
with
what
a
majesty
he
bears
himself
how
insolent
of
late
he
is
become
how
proud
how
peremptory
and
unlike
himself
we
know
the
time
since
he
was
mild
and
affable
and
if
we
did
but
glance
a
faroff
look
immediately
he
was
upon
his
knee
that
all
the
court
admird
him
for
submission
but
meet
him
now
and
be
it
in
the
morn
when
every
one
will
give
the
time
of
day
he
knits
his
brow
and
shows
an
angry
eye
and
passeth
by
with
stiff
unbowed
knee
disdaining
duty
that
to
us
belongs
small
curs
are
not
regarded
when
they
grin
but
great
men
tremble
when
the
lion
roars
and
humphrey
is
no
little
man
in
england
first
note
that
he
is
near
you
in
descent
and
should
you
fall
he
is
the
next
will
mount
me
seemeth
then
it
is
no
policy
respecting
what
a
rancorous
mind
he
bears
and
his
advantage
following
your
decease
that
he
should
come
about
your
royal
person
or
be
admitted
to
your
highness
council
by
flattery
hath
he
won
the
commons
hearts
and
when
he
please
to
make
commotion
tis
to
be
feard
they
all
will
follow
him
now
tis
the
spring
and
weeds
are
shallowrooted
suffer
them
now
and
theyll
oergrow
the
garden
and
choke
the
herbs
for
want
of
husbandry
the
reverent
care
i
bear
unto
my
lord
made
me
collect
these
dangers
in
the
duke
if
it
be
fond
can
it
a
womans
fear
which
fear
if
better
reasons
can
supplant
i
will
subscribe
and
say
i
wrongd
the
duke
my
lord
of
suffolk
buckingham
and
york
reprove
my
allegation
if
you
can
or
else
conclude
my
words
effectual
suffolk
well
hath
your
highness
seen
into
this
duke
and
had
i
first
been
put
to
speak
my
mind
i
think
i
should
have
told
your
graces
tale
the
duchess
by
his
subornation
upon
my
life
began
her
devilish
practices
or
if
he
were
not
privy
to
those
faults
yet
by
reputing
of
his
high
descent
as
next
the
king
he
was
successive
heir
and
such
high
vaunts
of
his
nobility
did
instigate
the
bedlam
brainsick
duchess
by
wicked
means
to
frame
our
sovereigns
fall
smooth
runs
the
water
where
the
brook
is
deep
and
in
his
simple
show
he
harbours
treason
the
fox
barks
not
when
he
would
steal
the
lamb
no
no
my
sovereign
gloucester
is
a
man
unsounded
yet
and
full
of
deep
deceit
cardinal
did
he
not
contrary
to
form
of
law
devise
strange
deaths
for
small
offences
done
york
and
did
he
not
in
his
protectorship
levy
great
sums
of
money
through
the
realm
for
soldiers
pay
in
france
and
never
sent
it
by
means
whereof
the
towns
each
day
revolted
buckingham
tut
these
are
petty
faults
to
faults
unknown
which
time
will
bring
to
light
in
smooth
duke
humphrey
king
henry
my
lords
at
once
the
care
you
have
of
us
to
mow
down
thorns
that
would
annoy
our
foot
is
worthy
praise
but
shall
i
speak
my
conscience
our
kinsman
gloucester
is
as
innocent
from
meaning
treason
to
our
royal
person
as
is
the
sucking
lamb
or
harmless
dove
the
duke
is
virtuous
mild
and
too
well
given
to
dream
on
evil
or
to
work
my
downfall
queen
ah
whats
more
dangerous
than
this
fond
affiance
seems
he
a
dove
his
feathers
are
but
borrowd
for
hes
disposed
as
the
hateful
raven
is
he
a
lamb
his
skin
is
surely
lent
him
for
hes
inclind
as
is
the
ravenous
wolf
who
cannot
steal
a
shape
that
means
deceit
take
heed
my
lord
the
welfare
of
us
all
hangs
on
the
cutting
short
that
fraudful
man

enter
somerset

somerset
all
health
unto
my
gracious
sovereign
king
henry
welcome
lord

your
interest
in
those
territories
is
utterly
bereft

lost
king

cold
news
lord
somerset
but
gods
will
be
done
york
aside
cold
news
for
me
for
i
had
hope
of
france
as
firmly
as
i
hope
for
fertile
england
thus
are
my
blossoms
blasted
in
the
bud
and
caterpillars
eat
my
leaves
away
but
i
will
remedy
this
gear
ere
long
or
sell
my
title
for
a
glorious
grave

enter

my
lord

wert
more

than
thou
art

do
arrest
thee
of
high
treason
here
gloucester
well
suffolk
thou
shalt
not
see
me
blush
nor
change
my
countenance
for
this
arrest
a
heart
unspotted
is
not
easily
daunted
the
purest
spring
is
not
so
free
from
mud
as
i
am
clear
from
treason
to
my
sovereign
who
can
accuse
me
wherein
am
i
guilty
york
tis
thought
my
lord
that
you
took
bribes
of
france
and
being
protector
stayd
the
soldiers
pay
by
means
whereof
his
highness
hath
lost
france
gloucester
is
it
but
thought
so
what
are
they
that
think
it
i
never
robbd
the
soldiers
of
their
pay
nor
ever
had
one
penny
bribe
from
france
so
help
me
god
as
i
have
watchd
the
night
ay
night
by
night
in
studying
good
for
england

doit
that
eer
i
wrested
from
the
king
or
any
groat
i
hoarded
to
my
use
be
brought
against
me
at
my
trialday
no
many
a
pound
of
mine
own
proper
store
because
i
would
not
tax
the
needy
commons
have
i
dispursed
to
the
garrisons
and
never
askd
for
restitution
cardinal
it
serves
you
well
my
lord
to
say
so
much
gloucester
i
say
no
more
than
truth
so
help
me
god
york
in
your
protectorship
you
did
devise
strange
tortures
for
offenders
never
heard
of
that
england
was
defamd
by
tyranny
gloucester
why
tis
well
known
that
whiles
i
was
protector
pity
was
all
the
fault
that
was
in
me
for
i
should
melt
at
an
offenders
tears
and
lowly
words
were
ransom
for
their
fault
unless
it
were
a
bloody
murderer
or
foul
felonious
thief
that
fleecd
poor
passengers
i
never
gave
them
condign
punishment
murder
indeed
that
bloody
sin
i
torturd
above
the
felon
or
what
trespass
else
suffolk
my
lord
these
faults
are
easy
quickly
answerd
but
mightier
crimes
are
laid
unto
your
charge
whereof
you
cannot
easily
purge
yourself
i
do
arrest
you
in
his
highness
name
and
here
commit
you
to
my
lord
cardinal
to
keep
until
your
further
time
of
trial
king
henry
my
lord
of
gloucester
tis
my
special
hope
that
you
will
clear
yourself
from
all
suspense
my
conscience
tells
me
you
are
innocent
gloucester
ah
gracious
lord
these
days
are
dangerous
virtue
is
chokd
with
foul
ambition
and
charity
chasd
hence
by
rancours
hand
foul
subornation
is
predominant
and
equity
exild
your
highness
land
i
know
their
complot
is
to
have
my
life
and
if
my
death
might
make
this
island
happy
and
prove
the
period
of
their
tyranny
i
would
expend
it
with
all
willingness
but
mine
is
made
the
prologue
to
their
play
for
thousands
more
that
yet
suspect
no
peril
will
not
conclude
their
plotted
tragedy
beauforts
red
sparkling
eyes
blab
his
hearts
malice
and
suffolks
cloudy
brow
his
stormy
hate
sharp
buckingham
unburdens
with
his
tongue
the
envious
load
that
lies
upon
his
heart
and
dogged
york
that
reaches
at
the
moon
whose
overweening
arm
i
have
pluckd
back
by
false
accuse
doth
level
at
my
life
and
you
my
sovereign
lady
with
the
rest
causeless
have
laid
disgraces
on
my
head
and
with
your
best
endeavour
have
stirrd
up
my
liefest
liege
to
be
mine
enemy
ay
all
of
you
have
laid
your
heads
together
myself
had
notice
of
your
conventicles
and
all
to
make
away
my
guiltless
life
i
shall
not
want
false
witness
to
condemn
me
nor
store
of
treasons
to
augment
my
guilt
the
ancient
proverb
will
be
well
effected
a
staff
is
quickly
found
to
beat
a
dog
cardinal
my
liege
his
railing
is
intolerable
if
those
that
care
to
keep
your
royal
person
from
treasons
secret
knife
and
traitors
rage
be
thus
upbraided
chid

of
speech
twill
make
them
cool

zeal
unto
your
grace
suffolk

our
sovereign

with
ignominious
words
though
clerkly
couchd
as
if
she
had
suborned
some
to
swear
false
allegations
to
oerthrow

but
i
can
give
the
loser
leave
to
chide
gloucester

than
meant

your

king
henry
ay
margaret
my
heart
is
drownd
with
grief
whose
flood
begins
to
flow
within
mine
eyes
my
body
round
engirt
with
misery
for
whats
more
miserable
than
discontent
ah
uncle
humphrey
in
thy
face
i
see
the
map
of
honour
truth
and
loyalty
and
yet
good
humphrey
is
the
hour
to
come
that
eer
i
provd
thee
false
or
feard
thy
faith
what
louring
star
now
envies
thy
estate
that
these
great
lords
and
margaret
our
queen
do
seek
subversion
of
thy
harmless
life
thou
never
didst
them
wrong
nor
no
man
wrong
and
as
the
butcher
takes
away
the
calf
and
binds
the
wretch
and
beats
it
when
it
strays
bearing
it
to
the
bloody
slaughterhouse
even
so
remorseless
have
they
borne
him
hence
and
as
the
dam
runs
lowing
up
and
down
looking
the
way
her
harmless
young
one
went
and
can
do
nought
but
wail
her
darlings
loss
even
so
myself
bewails
good
gloucesters
case
with
sad
unhelpful
tears
and
with
dimmd
eyes
look
after
him
and
cannot
do
him
good
so
mighty
are
his
vowed
enemies
his
fortunes
i
will
weep

twixt
each
groan

exit
queen
free
lords
cold
snow
melts
with
the
suns
hot
beams
henry
my
lord
is
cold
in
great
affairs
too
full
of
foolish
pity
and
gloucesters
show
beguiles
him
as
the
mournful
crocodile
with
sorrow
snares
relenting
passengers
or
as
the
snake
rolld
in
a
flowring
bank
with
shining
checkerd
slough
doth
sting
a
child
that
for
the
beauty
thinks
it
excellent
believe
me
lords
were
none
more
wise
than
i
and
yet
herein
i
judge
mine
own
wit
good
this
gloucester
should
be
quickly
rid
the
world
to
rid
us
from
the
fear
we
have
of
him
cardinal
that
he
should
die
is
worthy
policy
but
yet
we
want
a
colour
for
his
death
tis
meet
he
be
condemnd
by
course
of
law
suffolk
but
in
my
mind
that
were
no
policy
the
king
will
labour
still
to
save
his
life
the
commons
haply
rise
to
save
his
life
and
yet
we
have
but
trivial
argument
more
than
mistrust
that
shows
him
worthy
death
york
so
that
by
this
you
would
not
have
him
die
suffolk
ah
york
no
man
alive
so
fain
as
i
york
tis
york
that
hath
more
reason
for
his
death
but
my
lord
cardinal
and
you
my
lord
of
suffolk
say
as
you
think
and
speak
it
from
your
souls
weret
not
all
one
an
empty
eagle
were
set
to
guard
the
chicken
from
a
hungry
kite
as
place
duke
humphrey
for
the
kings
protector
queen
so
the
poor
chicken
should
be
sure
of
death
suffolk
madam
tis
true
and
weret
not
madness
then
to
make
the
fox
surveyor
of
the
fold
who
being
accusd
a
crafty
murderer
his
guilt
should
be
but
idly
posted
over
because
his
purpose
is
not
executed
no
let
him
die
in
that
he
is
a
fox
by
nature
provd
an
enemy
to
the
flock
before
his
chaps
be
staind
with
crimson
blood
as
humphrey
provd
by
reasons
to
my
liege
and
do
not
stand
on
quillets
how
to
slay
him
be
it
by
gins
by
snares
by
subtlety
sleeping
or
waking
tis
no
matter
how
so
he
be
dead
for
that
is
good
deceit
which
mates
him
first
that
first
intends
deceit
queen
thricenoble
suffolk
tis
resolutely
spoke
suffolk
not
resolute
except
so
much
were
done
for
things
are
often
spoke
and
seldom
meant
but
that
my
heart
accordeth
with
my
tongue
seeing
the
deed
is
meritorious
and
to
preserve
my
sovereign
from
his
foe
say
but
the
word
and
i
will
be
his
priest
cardinal
but
i
would
have
him
dead
my
lord
of
suffolk
ere
you
can
take
due
orders
for
a
priest
say
you
consent
and
censure
well
the
deed
and
ill
provide
his
executioner
i
tender
so
the
safety
of
my
liege
suffolk
here
is
my
hand
the
deed
is
worthy
doing
queen
and
so
say
i
york
and
i
and
now
we
three
have
spoke
it
it
skills
not
greatly
who
impugns
our
doom

and
stop
the
rage
betime
before
the
wound
do
grow
uncurable
for
being
green
there
is
great
hope
of
help

a
breach
that
craves
a
quick
expedient
stop
what
counsel
give
you
in
this
weighty
cause
york

lucky

employd
witness
the
fortune

hath
had
in
france
somerset
if
york
with
all
his
farfet
policy

been
the
regent
there
instead
of

he
never
would
have
stayd
in
france
so
long

not
to
lose
it
all
as
thou
hast
done
i
rather
would
have
lost
my

burden
of
dishonour

scar
characterd
on

mens

preservd
so
whole

brought
to
feed
it
with
no
more
good

sweet
somerset
be

have
i
seen
this
stubborn
cade
oppose
himself
against

troop
of
kerns
and
fought
so
long
tiff
that
his
thighs
with
darts
were
almost
like
a
sharpquilld
porpentine
and
in
the
end
being
rescud
i
have
seen
him
caper
upright
like
a
wild
morisco
shaking
the
bloody
darts
as
he
his
bells
full
often
like
a
shaghaird
crafty
kern
hath

undiscoverd
come

given

turn
our
stern
upon

aeolus
would
not

thou

have
me
drownd
on

as
salt

through
thy
unkindness
the
splitting
rocks
cowrd
in
the
sinking
sands

would
not
dash
me
with
their
ragged
sides

thy

heart
more
hard

might
in
thy
palace
perish

thy
chalky

hatches
in

when
the

began

i
took
a
costly
jewel
from
my
neck
a
heart
it
was
bound
in
with
diamonds
and
threw
it
towards
thy
land
the

receivd
it

so
i

my

even
with

i
lost

how
deep
my

is

with

fled
all

i
see
my

intends
to

with
that
dread
king
that
took
our
state
upon
him
to
free
us
from
his
fathers
wrathful
curse
i
do
believe
that
violent
hands
were
laid
upon
the
life
of
this
thricefamed
duke
suffolk
a
dreadful
oath
sworn
with
a
solemn
tongue
what
instance
gives
lord
warwick
for
his
vow
warwick
see
how
the
blood
is
settled
in
his
face
oft
have
i
seen
a
timelyparted
ghost
of
ashy
semblance
meagre
pale
and
bloodless
being
all
descended
to
the
labouring
heart
who
in
the
conflict
that
it
holds
with
death
attracts
the
same
for
aidance
gainst
the
enemy
which
with
the
heart
there
cools
and
neer
returneth
to
blush
and
beautify
the
cheek
again
but
see
his
face
is
black
and
full
of
blood
his
eyeballs
further
out
than
when
he
livd
staring
full
ghastly
like
a
strangled
man
his
hair
upreard
his
nostrils
stretchd
with
struggling
his
hands
abroad
displayd
as
one
that
graspd
and
tuggd
for
life
and
was
by
strength
subdud
look
on
the
sheets
his
hair
you
see
is
sticking
his
wellproportiond
beard
made
rough
and
rugged
like
to
the
summers
corn
by
tempest
lodged
it
cannot
be
but
he
was
murdred
here
the
least
of
all
these
signs
were
probable
suffolk
why
warwick
who
should
do
the
duke
to
death
myself
and
beaufort
had
him
in
protection
and
we
i
hope
sir
are
no
murderers
warwick
but
both
of
you
were
vowd
duke
humphreys
foes
and
you
forsooth
had
the
good
duke
to
keep
tis
like
you
would
not
feast
him
like
a
friend
and
tis
well
seen
he
found
an
enemy
queen
then
you
belike
suspect
these
noblemen
as
guilty
of
duke
humphreys
timeless
death
warwick
who
finds
the
heifer
dead
and
bleeding
fresh
and
sees
fast
by
a
butcher
with
an
axe
but
will
suspect
twas
he
that
made
the
slaughter
who
finds
the
partridge
in

may
imagine
how
the

was
dead

tumultuous
clamour
have
we
here
suffolk
the
traitrous
warwick
with
the
men
of

set
all
upon
me
mighty
sovereign

reenter
salisbury

salisbury
to
the
commons
within

stand
apart
the
king
shall
know
your
mind
dread
lord
the
commons
send
you
word
by
me
unless
lord
suffolk
straight
be
done
to
death
or
banished
fair
englands
territories
they
will
by
violence
tear
him
from
your
palace
and
torture
him
with
grievous
lingring
death
they
say
by
him
the
good
duke
humphrey
died
they
say
in
him
they
fear
your
highness
death
and
mere
instinct
of
love
and
loyalty
free
from
a
stubborn
opposite
intent
as
being
thought
to
contradict
your
liking
makes
them
thus
forward
in
his
banishment
they
say
in
care
of
your
most
royal
person
that
if
your
highness
should
intend
to
sleep
and
charge
that
no
man
should
disturb
your
rest
in
pain
of
your
dislike
or
pain
of
death
yet
notwithstanding
such
a
strait
edict
were
there
a
serpent
seen
with
forked
tongue
that
slily
glided
towards
your
majesty
it
were
but
necessary
you
were
wakd
lest
being
sufferd
in
that
harmful
slumber
the
mortal
worm
might
make
the
sleep
eternal
and
therefore
do
they
cry
though
you
forbid
that
they
will
guard
you
wheer
you
will
or
no
from
such
fell
serpents
as
false
suffolk
is
with
whose
envenomed
and
fatal
sting
your
loving
uncle
twenty
times
his
worth
they
say
is
shamefully
bereft
of
life
commons
within
an
answer
from
the
king
my
lord
of
salisbury
suffolk
tis
like
the
commons
rude
unpolishd
hinds
could
send
such

to
their
sovereign
but
you
my
lord
were
glad
to
be
employd
to
show
how
quaint
an
orator
you
are
but
all
the
honour
salisbury
hath
won
is
that
he
was
the
lord
ambassador
sent
from
a
sort
of
tinkers
to
the
king

within
an

his

tell

that
that
lord
say
hath
gelded
the
commonwealth
and
made
it
an
eunuch
and
more
than
that

buckingham
a
messenger
from
henry
our
dread
liege
to
know
the
reason
of
these
arms
in

or
why
thou
being
a
subject
as
i
am
against
thy
oath
and
true
allegiance
sworn
should
raise
so
great
a
power
without
his

or
dare
to
bring
thy
force
so
near
the
court
york

scarce

my
choler

ajax
telamonius
on

my
fury

wring
the
widow
from

customd
right

that
he
was
bound

at

what
is
your

how
began
it
first
edward
no

a

about

which
concerns
your

your

therefore
enjoy
it
now
by
giving
the

leave
to

it
will
outrun
you
father
in

york
i
took
an

that
he
should
quietly
reign

for
a

break

fight
when
they
can
fly
no

so
doves
do
peck
the
falcons
piercing
talons
so
desperate
thieves
all
hopeless
of
their
lives
breathe
out
invectives
gainst
the
officers
york
o
clifford
but
bethink
thee
once
again
and
in
thy
thought
oerrun
my
former
time
and
if
thou
canst
for
blushing
view
this
face
and
bite
thy
tongue
that
slanders
him
with
cowardice
whose
frown
hath
made
thee
faint
and
fly
ere
this
clifford
i
will
not
bandy
with
thee
word
for

with
thee
blows
twice

for
a
thousand
causes

him
deaf
speak
thou
northumberland
northumberland
hold
clifford
do
not
honour
him
so
much
to
prick
thy
finger
though
to
wound
his
heart
what
valour
were
it
when
a
cur
doth
grin
for
one
to
thrust
his
hand
between
his
teeth
when
he
might
spurn
him
with
his
foot
away
it
is
wars
prize
to
take
all
vantages
and
ten
to

is
no
impeach
of
valour
they
lay
hands
on
york
who
struggles
clifford
ay
ay
so
strives
the
woodcock
with
the
gin
northumberland
so
doth
the
cony
struggle
in
the
net
york
so
triumph
thieves
upon
their
conquerd
booty
so
true
men
yield
with
robbers
so
oermatchd
northumberland
what
would
your
grace
have
done
unto
him
now
queen
margaret
brave
warriors
clifford
and
northumberland
come
make
him
stand
upon
this
molehill
here
that
raught
at
mountains
with
outstretched
arms
yet
parted
but
the
shadow
with
his
hand
what
was
it
you
that
would
be
englands
king
wast
you
that
revelld
in
our
parliament
and
made
a
preachment
of
your
high
descent
where
are
your
mess
of
sons
to
back
you
now
the
wanton
edward
and
the
lusty
george
and
wheres
that
valiant
crookback
prodigy
dicky
your
boy
that
with
his
grumbling
voice
was
wont
to
cheer
his
dad
in
mutinies
or
with
the
rest
where
is
your
darling
rutland
look
york
i
staind
this
napkin
with
the
blood
that
valiant
clifford
with
his
rapiers
point
made
issue
from
the
bosom
of
the
boy
and
if
thine
eyes
can
water
for
his
death
i
give
thee
this
to
dry
thy
cheeks
withal
alas
poor
york
but
that
i
hate
thee
deadly
i
should
lament
thy
miserable
state
i
prithee
grieve
to
make
me
merry
york
what
hath
thy
fiery
heart
so
parchd
thine
entrails
that
not
a
tear
can
fall
for
rutlands
death
why
art
thou
patient
man
thou
shouldst
be
mad
and
i
to
make
thee
mad
do
mock
thee
thus
stamp
rave
and
fret
that
i
may
sing
and
dance
thou
wouldst
be
feed
i
see
to
make
me
sport
york
cannot
speak
unless
he
wear
a
crown
a
crown
for
yorkand
lords
bow
low
to
him
hold
you
his
hands
whilst
i
do
set
it
on
putting
a
paper
crown
on
his
head
ay
marry
sir
now
looks
he
like
a
king
ay
this
is
he
that
took
king
henrys
chair
and
this
is
he
was
his
adopted
heir
but
how
is
it
that
great
plantagenet
is
crownd
so
soon
and
broke
his
solemn
oath
as
i
bethink
me
you
should
not
be
king
till
our
king
henry
had
shook
hands
with
death
and
will
you
pale
your
head
in
henrys
glory
and
rob
his
temples
of
the
diadem
now
in
his
life
against
your
holy
oath
o
tis
a
fault
too
too
off
with
the
crown
and
with
the
crown
his
head
and
whilst
we
breathe
take
time
to
do
him
dead
clifford
that
is
my
office
for
my
fathers
sake
queen
margaret
nay
stay
lets
hear
the
orisons
he
makes
york
shewolf
of
france
but
worse
than
wolves
of
france
whose
tongue
more
poisons
than
the
adders
tooth
how
illbeseeming
is
it
in
thy
sex
to
triumph
like
an
amazonian
trull
upon
their
woes
whom
fortune
captivates
but
that
thy
face
is
visardlike
unchanging
made
impudent
with
use
of
evil
deeds
i
would
assay
proud
queen
to
make
thee
blush
to
tell
thee
whence
thou
camst
of
whom
derivd
were
shame
enough
to
shame
thee
wert
thou
not
shameless
thy
father
bears
the
type
of
king
of
naples
of
both
the
sicils
and
jerusalem
yet
not
so
wealthy
as
an
english
yeoman
hath
that
poor
monarch
taught
thee
to
insult
it
needs
not
nor
it
boots
thee
not
proud
queen
unless
the
adage
must
be
verified
that
beggars
mounted
run
their
horse
to
death
tis
beauty
that
doth
oft
make
women
proud
but
god
he
knows
thy
share
thereof
is
small
tis
virtue
that
doth
make
them
most
admird
the
contrary
doth
make
thee
wondred
at
tis
government
that
makes
them
seem
divine
the
want
thereof
makes
thee
abominable
thou
art
as
opposite
to
every
good
as
the
antipodes
are
unto
us
or
as
the
south
to
the
septentrion
o
tigers
heart
wrappd
in
a
womans
hide
how
couldst
thou
drain
the
lifeblood
of
the
child
to
bid
the
father
wipe
his
eyes
withal
and
yet
be
seen
to
bear
a
womans
face
women
are
soft
mild
pitiful
and
flexible
thou
stern
obdurate
flinty
rough
remorseless
bidst
thou
me
rage
why
now
thou
hast
thy
wish
wouldst
have
me
weep
why
now
thou
hast
thy
will
for
raging
wind
blows
up
incessant
showers
and
when
the
rage
allays
the
rain
begins
these
tears
are
my
sweet
rutlands
obsequies
and
every
drop
cries
vengeance
for
his
death
gainst
thee
fell
clifford
and
thee
false
frenchwoman
northumberland
beshrew
me
but
his
passions
move
me
so
that
hardly
can
i
check
my
eyes
from
tears
york
that
face
of
his
the
hungry
cannibals
would
not
have
touchd
would
not
have
staind
with
blood
but
you
are
more
inhuman
more
inexorable
o
ten
times
more
than
tigers
of
hyrcania
see
ruthless
queen
a
hapless
fathers
tears
this
cloth
thou
dippdst
in
blood
of
my
sweet
boy
and
i
with
tears
do
wash
the
blood
away
keep
thou
the
napkin
and
go
boast
of
this
and
if
thou
tellst
the
heavy
story
right
upon
my
soul
the
hearers
will
shed
tears
yea
even
my
foes
will
shed
fastfalling
tears
and
say
alas
it
was
a
piteous
deed
there
take
the
crown
and
with
the
crown
my
curse
and
in
thy
need
such
comfort
come
to
thee
as
now

reap
at
thy
too
cruel
hand

see
how
inly
sorrow
gripes
his
soul
