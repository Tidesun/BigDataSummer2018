my

mortified
the
grosser
manner
of
these
worlds
delights
he
throws
upon
the
gross

baser
slaves
to
love
to
wealth
to
pomp
i
pine
and
die
with
all
these
living
in

berowne
i
can
but
say
their
protestation
over
so
much
dear
liege
i
have
already
sworn
that
is
to
live
and
study
here
three
years
but
there
are
other
strict
observances
as
not
to
see
a
woman
in
that
term
which
i
hope
well
is
not
enrolled
there
and
one
day
in
a
week
to
touch
no
food
and
but
one
meal
on
every
day
beside
the
which
i
hope
is
not
enrolled
there
and
then
to
sleep
but
three
hours
in
the
night
and
not
be
seen
to
wink
of
all
the
day
when
i
was
wont
to
think
no
harm
all
night
and
make
a
dark
night
too
of
half
the
day
which
i
hope
well
is
not
enrolled
there
o
these
are
barren
tasks
too
hard
to
keep
not
to
see
ladies
study
fast
not
sleep
king
your
oath
is
passd
to
pass
away
from
these
berowne
let
me
say
no
my
liege
an
if
you
please
i
only
swore
to
study
with
your
grace
and
stay
here
in
your
court
for
three
years
space
longaville
you
swore
to
that
berowne
and
to
the
rest
berowne
by
yea
and
nay
sir
then
i
swore
in
jest
what
is
the
end
of
study
let
me
know
king
why
that
to
know
which
else
we
should
not
know
berowne
things
hid
and
barrd
you
mean
from
common
sense
king
ay
that
is
studys
godlike
recompense
berowne
come
on
then
i
will
swear
to
study
so
to
know
the
thing
i
am
forbid
to
know
as
thus
to
study
where
i
well
may
dine
when
i
to
feast
expressly
am
forbid
or
study
where
to
meet
some
mistress
fine
when
mistresses
from
common
sense
are
hid
or
having
sworn
too
hardakeeping
oath
study
to
break
it
and
not
break
my
troth
if
studys
gain
be
thus
and
this
be
so
study
knows
that
which
yet
it
doth
not
know
swear
me
to
this
and
i
will
neer
say
no
king
these
be
the
stops
that
hinder
study
quite
and
train
our
intellects
to
vain
delight
berowne
why
all
delights
are
vain
but
that
most
vain
which
with
pain
purchasd
doth
inherit
pain
as
painfully
to
pore
upon
a
book
to
seek
the
light
of
truth
while
truth
the
while
doth
falsely
blind
the
eyesight
of
his
look
light
seeking
light
doth
light
of
light
beguile
so
ere
you
find
where
light
in
darkness
lies
your
light
grows
dark
by
losing
of
your
eyes
study
me
how
to
please
the
eye
indeed
by
fixing
it
upon
a
fairer
eye
who
dazzling
so
that
eye
shall
be
his
heed
and
give
him
light
that
it
was
blinded
by
study
is
like
the
heavens
glorious
sun
that
will
not
be
deepsearchd
with
saucy
looks
small
have
continual
plodders
ever
won
save
base
authority
from
others
books
these
earthly
godfathers
of
heavens
lights
that
give
a
name
to
every
fixed
star
have
no
more
profit
of
their
shining
nights
than
those
that
walk
and
wot
not
what
they
are
too
much
to
know
is
to
know
nought
but
fame
and
every
godfather
can
give
a
name
king
how
well
hes
read
to
reason
against
reading
dumain
proceeded
well
to
stop
all
good
proceeding
longaville
he
weeds
the
corn
and
still
lets
grow
the
weeding
berowne
the
spring
is
near
when
green
geese
are
abreeding
dumain
how
follows
that
berowne
fit
in
his
place
and
time
dumain
in
reason
nothing
berowne
something
then
in
rhyme
longaville
berowne
is
like
an
envious
sneaping
frost
that
bites
the
firstborn
infants
of
the
spring
berowne
well
say
i
am
why
should
proud
summer
boast
before
the
birds
have
any
cause
to
sing
why

i
joy
in
any
abortive
birth
at

no

a
snow
in

of

grows
so

to

late

little

king
well
sit
out

home
berowne
adieu
berowne
no
my
good
lord
i
have
sworn
to
stay
with
you
and
though
i
have
for
barbarism
spoke
more
than
for
that
angel
knowledge
you
can
say
yet
confident
ill
keep
what
i
have
swore
and
bide
the
penance
of
each
three
years
day
give
me
the
paper
let
me
read
the
same
and
to
the
strictest
decrees
ill
write
my
name
king
how
well
this
yielding
rescues
thee
from
shame
berowne
reads
item
that
no
woman
shall
come
within
a
mile
of
my
court
hath
this
been
proclaimed
longaville
four
days
ago
berowne
lets
see
the
penalty
reads
on
pain
of
losing
her
tongue
who
devisd
this
penalty
longaville
marry
that
did
i
berowne
sweet
lord
and
why
longaville
to
fright
them
hence
with
that
dread
penalty
berowne
a
dangerous
law
against
gentility
reads
item
if
any
man
be
seen
to
talk
with
a
woman
within
the
term
of
three
years
he
shall
endure
such
public
shame
as
the
rest
of
the
court
can
possibly
devise
this
article
my
liege
yourself
must
break
for
well
you
know
here
comes
in
embassy
the
french
kings
daughter
with
yourself
to
speak
a
mild
of
grace
and
complete
majesty
about
surrender
up
of
aquitaine
to
her
decrepit
sick
and
bedrid
father
therefore
this
article
is
made
in
vain
or
vainly
comes
th
admired
princess
hither
king
what
say
you
lords
why
this
was
quite
forgot
berowne
so
study
evermore
is
overshot
while
it
doth
study
to
have
what
it
would
it
doth
forget
to
do
the
thing
it
should
and
when
it
hath
the
thing
it
hunteth
most
tis
won
as
towns
with
fire
so
won
so
lost
king
we
must
of
force
dispense
with
this
decree
she
must
lie
here
on
mere
necessity
berowne
necessity
will
make
us
all
forsworn
three
thousand
times
within
this
three
years
space
for
every
man
with
his
affects
is
born
not
by
might
mastred
but
by
special
grace
if
i
break
faith
this
word
shall
speak
for
me
i
am
forsworn
on
mere
necessity
so
to
the
laws
at
large
i
write
my
name







subscribes
and
he
that
breaks
them
in
the
least
degree
stands
in
attainder
of
eternal
shame
suggestions
are
to
other
as
to
me
but
i
believe
although
i
seem
so
loath
i
am
the
last
that
will
last
keep
his
oath
but
is
there
no
quick
recreation
granted
king
ay
that
there
is
our
court
you
know
is
haunted
with
a
refined
traveller
of
spain
a
man
in
all
the
worlds
new
fashion
planted
that
hath
a
mint
of
phrases
in
his
brain
one
who
the
music
of
his
own
vain
tongue
doth
ravish
like
enchanting
harmony
a
man
of
complements
whom
right
and
wrong
have
chose
as
umpire
of
their
mutiny
this
child
of
fancy
that
armado
hight
for
interim
to
our
studies
shall
relate
in
highborn
words
the
worth
of
many
a
knight
from
tawny
spain
lost
in
the
worlds
debate
how
you
delight
my
lords
i
know
not
i
but
i
protest
i
love
to
hear

how

falsely
attempted
love

his

a
mirthmoving
jest

his

thousand
more

which
one
part

one
half
which
is
unsatisfied
we
will
give
up
our
right
in

his
majesty

that
it
seems
he
little
purposeth
for
here
he
doth
demand
to
have
repaid
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
and
not
demands
on
payment
of
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
to
have
his
title
live
in
aquitaine

we
much
rather
had
depart
withal

the
steep
uprising
of
the
hill

i
think
it
was
not
he
princess
of

whoeer
a
was
a
showd
a
mounting
mind
well
lords
today
we
shall
have
our
dispatch
on
saturday

will
return
to
france
then
forester
my
friend
where
is
the
bush
that
we
must
stand
and
play
the
murderer
in
forester
hereby
upon
the
edge
of
yonder
coppice
a
stand
where
you
may
make
the
fairest
shoot
princess
of
france
i
thank
my
beauty
i
am
fair
that
shoot
and
thereupon
thou
speakst
the
fairest
shoot
forester
pardon
me
madam
for
i
meant
not
so
princess
of
france
what
what
first
praise
me
and
again
say
no
o
shortlivd
pride
not
fair
alack
for
woe
forester
yes
madam
fair
princess
of
france
nay
never
paint
me
now
where
fair
is
not
praise
cannot
mend
the
brow
here
good
my
glass
take
this
for
telling
true

giving

more
than
due

have
fair
praise

come

mercy
goes
to
kill

then
accounted
ill
thus
will
i
save
my
credit
in
the
shoot
not
wounding
pity
would
not
let
me
dot
if
wounding
then
it
was
to
show
my
skill
that
more
for
praise
than
purpose
meant
to
kill
and
out
of
question
so
it
is
sometimes
glory
grows
guilty
of
detested
crimes
when
for
fames
sake
for
praise
an
outward
part
we
bend
to
that
the
working
of
the
heart
as
i
for
praise
alone
now
seek
to
spill
the
poor
deers
blood
that
my
heart
means
no
ill
boyet
do
not

selfsovereignty
only
for

sake
when
they
strive
to
be
lords

thy

it
mourns
that

should
ravish
doters
with

false

and
therefore
is
she
born
to
make
black
fair
her
favour
turns
the
fashion
of
the

for

is
counted
painting

berowne
tis
more
than
need
have
at

then

consider
what
you
first
did
swear
unto
to
fast
to
study
and
to
see
no
woman
flat
treason
gainst
the
kingly
state
of
youth
say
can
you
fast
your
stomachs
are
too
young
and
abstinence
engenders
maladies
and
where
that
you
you
have
vowd
to
study
lords
in
that
each
of
you
have
forsworn
his
book
can
you
still
dream
and
pore
and
thereon
look
for
when
would
you
my
lord
or
you
or
you
have
found
the
ground
of
studys
excellence
without
the
beauty
of
a
womans
face
from
womens
eyes
this
doctrine
i
derive
they
are
the
ground
the
books
the
academes
from
whence
doth
spring
the
true
promethean
fire
why
universal
plodding
poisons
up
the
nimble
spirits
in
the
arteries
as
motion
and
longduring
action
tires
the
sinewy
vigour
of
the
traveller
now
for
not
looking
on
a
womans
face
you
have
in
that
forsworn
the
use
of
eyes
and
study
too
the
causer
of
your
vow
for
where
is
author
in
the
world
teaches
such
beauty
as
a
womans
eye
learning
is
but
an
adjunct
to
ourself
and
where
we
are
our
learning
likewise
is
then
when
ourselves
we
see
in
ladies
eyes
with
ourselves
do
we
not
likewise
see
our
learning
there
o
we
have
made
a
vow
to
study
lords
and
in
that
vow
we
have
forsworn
our
books
for
when
would
you
my
liege
or
you
or
you
in
leaden
contemplation
have
found
out
such
fiery
numbers
as
the
prompting
eyes
of
beautys
tutors
have
enrichd
you
with
other
slow
arts
entirely
keep
the
brain
and
therefore
finding
barren
practisers
scarce
show
a
harvest
of
their
heavy
toil
but
love
first
learned
in
a
ladys
eyes
lives
not
alone
immured
in
the
brain
but
with
the
motion
of
all
elements
courses
as
swift
as
thought
in
every
power
and
gives
to
every
power
a
double
power
above
their
functions
and
their
offices
it
adds
a
precious
seeing
to
the
eye
a
lovers
eyes
will
gaze
an
eagle
blind
a
lovers
ear
will
hear
the
lowest
sound
when
the
suspicious
head
of
theft
is
stoppd

feeling
is
more
soft
and
sensible
than
are
the
tender

o
then

some
half
an

when
lo
to
interrupt
my
purposd
rest
toward
that
shade
i
might
behold

warily
i
stole
into
a

overheard
what
you
shall
overhear
that
by
and
by
disguisd
they
will
be
here
their
herald
is
a
pretty
knavish
page
that
well
by
heart
hath
connd
his
embassage
action
and
accent
did
they
teach
him
there
thus
must
thou
speak
and
thus
thy
body
bear
and
ever
and
anon
they
made
a
doubt

would
put

out
for
quoth
the
king
an
angel
shalt
thou
see
yet
fear
not

the

have
feard

had
she
been

that
all
laughd

clappd

down
he
fell
with
that
they
all
did
tumble
on
the

with
such
a
zealous
laughter
so
profound
that
in
this
spleen
ridiculous
appears
to
check
their
folly

solemn
tears
princess

but
what
but
what
come
they
to
visit
us
boyet
they
do
they
do
and
are
apparelld
thus
like
muscovites
or
russians
as
i
guess
their
purpose
is
to
parley
court
and
dance
and
every
one
his
lovefeat
will
advance
unto
his
several
mistress
which
theyll
know
by
favours
several
which
they
did
bestow
princess
of
france
and
will
they
so
the
gallants
shall
be
taskd
for
ladies
we
will
every
one
be
maskd
and
not
a
man
of
them
shall
have
the
grace
despite
of
suit
to
see
a
ladys
face
hold
rosaline
this
favour
thou
shalt
wear
and
then
the
king
will
court
thee
for
his
dear
hold
take
thou
this
my
sweet
and
give
me
thine
so
shall
berowne
take
me
for
rosaline
and
change
you
favours
too
so

your

woo
contrary
deceivd
by
these

then
wear
the
favours
most
in
sight
katharine
but
in
this
changing
what
is
your
intent
princess

the
effect
of
my
intent
is
to
cross
theirs
they
do
it
but
in
mocking
merriment
and
mock
for
mock
is
only
my
intent
their
several
counsels
they
unbosom
shall
to
loves
mistook
and
so
be
mockd
withal
upon
the
next
occasion
that
we
meet
with
visages
displayd
to
talk
and
greet
rosaline
but
shall
we
dance
if
they
desire
us
tot
princess

no
to
the
death
we
will
not
move
a
foot
nor
to
their
pennd
speech
render
we
no
grace
but
while
tis
spoke
each
turn
away

boyet
why
that
contempt
will
kill
the

heart
and
quite
divorce
his

my

they
did
not

dry
to

your
capacity
is
of
that
nature
that
to
your
huge

wise
things
seem
foolish

rich
things

proves
you
wise

full
of

vouchsafe
in

hide
the
liberal
opposition
of
our

borne

your

was
guilty
of

farewell
worthy

excuse

so
coming
too
short
of
thanks
for
my
great
suit
so
easily
obtaind
king
the
extreme
parts
of

extremely
forms
all
causes
to
the
purpose
of
his
speed
and
often
at
his
very
loose
decides
that
which
long
process
could
not
arbitrate
and
though
the
mourning
brow
of
progeny
forbid
the
smiling
courtesy
of
love
the
holy
suit
which
fain
it
would
convince
yet
since
loves
argument
was
first
on
foot
let
not
the
cloud
of
sorrow
justle
it
from
what
it
purposd
since
to
wail
friends
lost
is
not
by
much
so
wholesomeprofitable
as
to
rejoice
at
friends

newly

i
understand
you
not
my
griefs
are
double
berowne
honest
plain
words
best
pierce
the
ear
of
grief
and
by
these
badges
understand
the
king
for
your
fair
sakes
have
we
neglected
time
playd
foul
play
with
our
oaths
your
beauty
ladies
hath
much
deformed
us
fashioning
our
humours
even
to
the
opposed
end
of
our
intents
and
what
in
us
hath
seemd
ridiculous
as
love
is
full
of
unbefitting
strains
all
wanton
as
a
child
skipping
and
vain
formd
by
the
eye
and
therefore
like
the
eye
full
of
strange
shapes
of
habits
and
of
forms
varying
in
subjects
as
the
eye
doth
roll
to
every
varied
object
in
his
glance
which
particoated
presence
of
loose
love
put
on
by
us
if
in
your
heavenly
eyes
have
misbecomd
our
oaths
and
gravities
those
heavenly
eyes
that
look
into
these
faults
suggested
us
to
make
therefore
ladies
our
love
being
yours
the
error
that
love
makes
is
likewise
yours
we
to
ourselves
prove
false
by
being
once
false
for
ever
to
be
true
to
those
that
make
us
both
fair
ladies
you
and
even
that
falsehood
in
itself
a
sin
thus
purifies
itself
and
turns
to
grace
princess
of
france
we
have
receivd
your
letters
full
of
love
your
favours
the
ambassadors
of
love
and
in
our
maiden
council
rated
them
at
courtship
pleasant
jest
and
courtesy
as
bombast
and
as
lining
to
the
time
but
more
devout
than
this
in
our
respects
have
we
not
been
and
therefore
met
your
loves
in
their
own
fashion
like
a
merriment
dumain
our
letters
madam
showd
much
more
than
jest
longaville
so
did
our

rosaline
we
did
not
quote
them
so
king
now
at
the
latest
minute
of
the
hour
grant
us
your
loves
princess
of
france
a
time
methinks
too
short
to
make
a
worldwithoutend
bargain
in
no
no
my
lord
your
grace
is
perjurd
much
full
of
dear
guiltiness
and
therefore
this
if
for
my
love
as
there
is
no
such
cause
you
will
do
aught
this
shall
you
do
for
me
your
oath
i
will
not
trust
but
go
with
speed
to
some
forlorn
and
naked
hermitage
remote
from
all
the
pleasures
of
the
world
there
stay
until
the
twelve
celestial
signs
have
brought
about
the
annual
reckoning
if
this
austere
insociable
life
change
not
your
offer
made
in
heat
of
blood
if
frosts
and
fasts
hard
lodging
and
thin
weeds
nip
not
the
gaudy
blossoms
of
your
love
but
that
it
bear
this
trial
and
last
love
then
at
the
expiration
of
the
year
come
challenge
me
challenge
me
by
these
deserts
and
by
this
virgin
palm
now
kissing
thine
i
will
be
thine
and
till
that
instant
shut
my
woeful
self
up
in
a
mournful
house
raining
the
tears
of
lamentation
for
the
remembrance
of
my
fathers
death
if
this
thou
do
deny
let
our
hands
part
neither
intitled
in
the

if
this
or
more
than
this
i
would
deny
to
flatter
up
these
powers
of
mine
with
rest
the
sudden
hand
of
death
close
up
mine
eye
hence
hermit
then
my

is
in

to
me
rosaline
you
must
he
purged
too
your
sins
are

flouts

two

if

why

crown

new

come
upon

like
our
strange

cleave
not
to
their
mould
but
with
the
aid
of
use
macbeth

your

my
dull

i
turn
the

to

them
let
us
toward
the

think
upon
what
hath
chanced
and
at
more
time
the

having
weighd
it
let

ere

that
you
do
lie
so
late
porter
faith
sir
we
were
carousing
till
the
second
cock
and
drink
sir
is
a
great
provoker
of
three
things
macduff
what
three
things
does
drink
especially
provoke
porter
marry
sir
nosepainting
sleep
and
urine
lechery
sir
it
provokes
and
unprovokes
it
provokes
the
desire
but
it
takes
away
the
performance
therefore
much
drink
may
be
said
to
be
an
equivocator
with
lechery
it
makes
him
and
it
mars
him
it
sets
him
on
and
it
takes
him
off
it
persuades
him
and
disheartens
him
makes
him
stand
to
and
not
stand
to
in
conclusion
equivocates
him
in
a
sleep
and
giving
him
the
lie
leaves
him
macduff
i
believe
drink
gave
thee
the
lie
last

throat

requited
him

being

were
distracted
no

may
claim
this
argument
for
ours
donalbain
aside
to
malcolm
what
should
be
spoken
here
where
our
fate
hid
in
an
auger
hole
may
rush
and
seize
us
lets
away
our
tears
are
not

carried
out
and
when
we
have
our
naked
frailties
hid
that
suffer
in
exposure
let
us
meet
and
question
this
most
bloody
piece
of
work
to
know
it
further
fears
and
scruples
shake
us
in
the
great
hand
of
god

donalbain
malcolm
what

you
do

i
our

bloody
malcolm
this
murtherous
shaft
thats

to
horse
and
let
us
not
be
dainty
of
leavetaking
but
shift
away
theres
warrant
in

in
his
royalty
of
nature
reigns
that
which

feard
tis
much
he
dares
and
to
that
dauntless
temper
of
his
mind
he
hath
a
wisdom
that
doth
guide
his
valor
to
act
in
safety
there
is
none
but
he
whose
being
i
do
fear
and
under
him
my
genius
is
rebuked
as
it
is
said
mark
antonys
was
by
caesar
he
chid
the
sisters
when
first
they
put
the
name
of
king
upon
me
and
bade
them
speak
to
him
then
prophetlike
they
haild
him
father
to
a
line
of
kings
upon
my
head
they
placed
a
fruitless
crown
and
put
a
barren
sceptre
in
my
gripe
thence
to
be
wrenchd
with
an
unlineal
hand
no
son
of
mine
succeeding
ift
be
so
for
banquos
issue
have
i
filed
my
mind
for
them
the
gracious
duncan
have
i
murtherd
put
rancors
in
the
vessel
of
my
peace
only
for
them
and
mine
eternal
jewel
given
to
the
common
enemy
of
man
to
make
them
kings
the
seed
of
banquo
kings
rather
than

into
the
list
and

to
the

not
yesterday
we
spoke
together
first
murtherer
it
was
so
please
your
highness
macbeth
well
then
now
have
you
considerd
of
my
speeches
know
that
it
was
he
in
the
times
past
which
held
you
so
under
fortune
which
you
thought
had
been
our
innocent
self
this
i
made
good
to
you
in
our
last
conference
passd
in
probation
with
you
how
you
were
borne
in
hand
how
crossd
the
instruments
who
wrought
with
them
and
all
things
else
that
might
to
half
a
soul
and
to
a
notion
crazed
say
thus
did
banquo
first
murtherer
you
made
it
known
to
us
macbeth
i
did
so
and
went
further
which
is
now
our
point
of
second
meeting
do
you
find
your
patience
so
predominant
in
your
nature
that
you
can
let
this
go
are
you
so
gospeld
to
pray
for
this
good
man
and
for
his
issue
whose
heavy
hand
hath
bowd
you
to
the
grave
and
beggard
yours
forever
first
murtherer
we
are
men
my
liege
macbeth
ay
in
the
catalogue
ye
go
for
men
as
hounds
and
greyhounds
mongrels
spaniels
curs
shoughs
waterrugs
and
demiwolves
are
clept
all
by
the
name
of
dogs
the
valued
file
distinguishes
the
swift
the
slow
the
subtle
the
housekeeper
the
hunter
every
one
according
to
the
gift
which
bounteous
nature
hath
in
him
closed
whereby
he
does
receive
particular
addition
from
the
bill
that
writes
them
all
alike
and
so
of
men
now
if
you
have
a
station
in
the
file
not
i
the
worst
rank
of
manhood
say
it
and
i
will
put
that
business
in
your
bosoms
whose
execution
takes
your
enemy
off
grapples
you
to
the
heart
and
love
of
us
who
wear
our
health
but
sickly
in
his
life
which
in
his
death
were
perfect
second
murtherer
i
am
one
my
liege
whom
the
vile
blows
and
buffets
of
the
world
have
so
incensed
that
i
am
reckless
what
i
do
to
spite
the
world
first
murtherer
and
i
another
so
weary
with
disasters
tuggd
with
fortune
that
i
would
set
my
life
on
any
chance
to
mend
it
or
be
rid
ont
macbeth
both
of
you
know
banquo
was
your
enemy
both
murtherers
true
my
lord
macbeth
so
is
he
mine
and
in
such
bloody
distance
that
every
minute
of
his
being
thrusts
against
my
nearst
of
life
and
though
i
could
with
barefaced
power
sweep
him
from
my
sight
and
bid
my
will
avouch
it
yet
i
must
not
for
certain
friends
that
are
both
his
and
mine
whose
loves
i
may
not
drop
but
wail
his
fall
who
i
myself
struck
down
and
thence
it
is
that
i
to
your
assistance
do
make
love
masking
the
business
from
the
common
eye
for
sundry
weighty
reasons
second
murtherer
we
shall
my
lord
perform
what
you
command
us
first
murtherer

our
lives

holds
the
due
of

lives
in
the
english
court
and
is
received
of
the
most
pious
edward
with
such
grace
that
the
malevolence
of
fortune
nothing
takes
from
his
high
respect
thither
macduff
is
gone
to
pray
the
holy
king
upon

that
well

caution
to

what
distance
his
wisdom
can
provide
some
holy
angel
fly
to
the
court
of
england
and
unfold
his
message
ere
he
come
that
a
swift
blessing
may

you
must
have
patience
madam
lady
macduff
he
had

his
flight

madness
when
our
actions
do
not
our
fears
do
make
us
traitors
ross
you
know

whether
it
was
his
wisdom

in
her
nest
against
the
owl
all
is
the
fear
and
nothing
is
the

is
the
wisdom

against
all
reason

and
macduff

malcolm
let
us
seek
out
some
desolate
shade
and
there
weep
our
sad
bosoms
empty
macduff
let
us
rather
hold
fast
the
mortal
sword
and
like
good
men
bestride
our
downfalln
birthdom
each
new
morn
new
widows
howl
new
orphans
cry
new
sorrows
strike
heaven
on
the
face
that
it
resounds
as
if
it
felt
with
scotland
and
yelld
out
like
syllable
of
dolor
malcolm
what
i
believe
ill
wall
what
know

and
what
i
can
redress
as
i
shall
find
the
time
to
friend
i
will
what
you
have
spoke
it
may
be
so
perchance
this
tyrant
whose
sole
name
blisters
our
tongues
was
once
thought
honest
you
have
loved
him
well
he
hath
not
touchd
you
yet
i
am
young
but
something
you
may
deserve
of
him
through
me
and
wisdom
to
offer
up
a
weak
poor
innocent
lamb
to
appease
an
angry
god
macduff
i
am
not
treacherous
malcolm
but
macbeth
is
a
good
and
virtuous
nature
may
recoil
in
an
imperial
charge
but
i
shall
crave
your
pardon
that
which
you
are
my
thoughts
cannot
transpose
angels
are
bright
still
though
the
brightest
fell
though
all
things
foul
would
wear
the
brows
of
grace
yet
grace
must
still
look
so
macduff
i
have
lost
my
hopes
malcolm
perchance
even
there
where
i
did
find
my
doubts
why
in
that
rawness
left
you
wife
and
child
those
precious
motives
those
strong
knots
of
love
without
leavetaking
i
pray
you
let
not
my
jealousies
be
your
dishonors
but
mine
own
safeties
you
may
be
rightly
just
whatever
i
shall
think
macduff
bleed
bleed
poor
country
great
tyranny
lay
thou
thy
basis
sure
for
goodness
dare
not
check
thee
wear
thou
thy
wrongs
the
title
is
affeerd
fare
thee
well
lord
i
would
not
be
the
villain
that
thou
thinkst
for
the
whole
space
thats
in
the
tyrants
grasp
and
the
rich
east
to
boot
malcolm
be
not
offended
i
speak
not
as
in
absolute
fear
of
you
i
think
our
country
sinks
beneath
the
yoke
it
weeps
it
bleeds
and
each
new
day
a
gash
is
added
to
her
wounds
i
think
withal
there
would
be
hands
uplifted
in
my
right
and
here
from
gracious
england
have
i
offer
of
goodly
thousands
but
for
all
this
when
i
shall
tread
upon
the
tyrants
head
or
wear
it
on
my
sword
yet
my
poor
country
shall
have
more
vices
than
it
had
before
more
suffer
and
more
sundry
ways
than
ever
by
him
that
shall
succeed
macduff
what
should
he
be
malcolm
it
is
myself
i
mean
in
whom
i
know
all
the
particulars
of
vice
so
grafted
that
when
they
shall
be
opend
black
macbeth
will
seem
as
pure
as
snow
and
the
poor
state
esteem
him
as
a
lamb
being
compared
with
my
confineless
harms
macduff
not
in
the
legions
of
horrid
hell
can
come
a
devil
more
damnd
in
evils
to
top
macbeth
malcolm
i
grant
him
bloody
luxurious
avaricious
false
deceitful
sudden
malicious
smacking
of
every
sin
that
has
a
name
but
theres
no
bottom
none
in
my
voluptuousness
your
wives
your
daughters
your
matrons
and
your

could
not
fill
up
the
cestern
of
my
lust

my
desire
all
continent
impediments
would
oerbear
that
did
oppose
my

better
macbeth
than
such
an
one
to
reign
macduff
boundless
intemperance
in
nature
is
a
tyranny
it
hath
been
the
untimely
emptying
of
the
happy
throne
and
fall
of
many
kings
but
fear
not
yet
to
take
upon
you
what
is
yours
you
may
convey
your
pleasures
in
a
spacious
plenty
and
yet
seem
cold
the
time
you
may
so
hoodwink
we
have
willing

enough
there
cannot
be
that
vulture
in
you
to
devour
so
many
as
will

dedicate
themselves
finding
it
so
inclined
malcolm
with
this
there
grows
in
my
most
illcomposed
affection
such
a
stanchless
avarice
that
were
i
king
i
should
cut
off
the
nobles
for
their
lands
desire
his
jewels
and
this
others
house
and
my
morehaving
would
be
as
a
sauce
to
make
me
hunger
more
that
i
should
forge
quarrels
unjust
against
the
good

loyal
destroying
them
for

macduff
this
avarice
sticks
deeper
grows
with
more
pernicious
root
than
summerseeming

and
it
hath
been
the
sword
of
our
slain

not

scotland
hath
foisons
to
fill
up
your

of

all
these
are

thy

thee
oftener
upon

well
these
evils
thou

upon

have
banishd
me
from

o
my

thy
hope
ends
here
malcolm
macduff
this
noble
passion
child
of
integrity
hath
from
my
soul
wiped
the
black
scruples
reconciled
my
thoughts
to
thy
good
truth
and
honor
devilish
macbeth
by
many
of
these
trains
hath
sought
to
win
me
into
his
power
and
modest
wisdom
plucks
me
from
overcredulous
haste
but
god
above
deal
between
thee
and
me
for
even
now
i
put
myself
to
thy
direction
and
unspeak
mine
own
detraction
here
abjure
the
taints
and
blames
i
laid
upon
myself
for
strangers
to
my
nature
i
am
yet
unknown
to
woman
never
was
forsworn
scarcely
have
coveted
what
was
mine
own
at
no
time
broke
my
faith
would
not
betray
the
devil
to
his
fellow
and
delight
no
less
in
truth
than
life
my
first
false
speaking
was
this
upon
myself
what
i
am
truly
is
thine
and
my
poor
countrys
to
command
whither
indeed
before
thy
hereapproach
old
siward
with
ten
thousand
warlike
men
already
at
a
point
was
setting
forth
now
well
together

goodness
be
like
our
warranted
quarrel
why
are
you
silent
macduff
such
welcome
and
unwelcome
things
at

strange

our
grave
where
nothing

nothing
is
once
seen
to
smile
where
sighs
and
groans
and
shrieks
that
rend
the
air
are
made
not
markd
where
violent
sorrow
seems
a
modern
ecstasy
the
dead
mans
knell
is

scarce
askd
for
who
and
good
mens
lives
expire
before
the
flowers

my

the
rather
for

saw
the
tyrants
power

macduff
what

the
general
cause
or

single
breast

a
wise
burgher

our
houses
of
resort
in
the
suburbs
be
pulld

a
change
indeed
in
the
commonwealth

fear
not
you
good

lack
no
clients
though
you

your
place
you
need
not
change
your
trade
ill
be
your
tapster
still
courage
there
will
be
pity
taken
on

almost
out
in
the
service
you
will
be
considered
mrs

whats

here
thomas
tapster
lets
withdraw
pompey
here
comes
signior
claudio
led
by
the
provost
to
prison
and
theres
madam
juliet




























exeunt

enter
provost
claudio
juliet
and
officers
lucio
following

claudio
fellow
why
dost
thou
show
me
thus
to
th
world
bear
me
to
prison
where
i
am
committed
provost
i
do
it
not
in
evil
disposition
but
from
lord
angelo
by
special
charge
claudio
thus
can
the
demigod
authority
make
us
pay
down
for
our
offence
by
weight
the
words
of
heaven
on
whom
it
will
it
will
on
whom
it
will
not
so
yet
still
tis
just
lucio
why
how
now
claudio
whence
comes
this
restraint
claudio
from
too
much
liberty
my
lucio
liberty
as
surfeit
is
the
father
of
much
fast
so
every
scope
by
the
immoderate
use
turns
to
restraint
our
natures
do
pursue
like
rats
that
ravin
down
their
proper
bane
a
thirsty
evil
and
when
we
drink
we
die
lucio
if
i
could
speak
so
wisely
under
an
arrest
i
would
send
for
certain
of
my
creditors
and
yet
to
say
the
truth
i
had
as
lief
have
the
foppery
of
freedom
as
the
morality
of
imprisonment
whats
thy
offence
claudio
claudio
what
but
to
speak
of
would
offend
again
lucio
what
ist
murder
claudio
no
lucio
lechery
claudio
call
it
so
provost
away
sir
you
must
go
claudio
one
word
good
friend
lucio
a
word
with
you
lucio
a
hundred
if
theyll
do
you
any
good
is
lechery
so
lookd
after
claudio
thus
stands
it
with
me
upon
a
true
contract
i
got
possession
of
juliettas
bed
you
know
the
lady
she
is
fast
my
wife
save
that
we
do
the
denunciation
lack
of
outward
order
this
we
came
not
to
only
for
propagation
of
a
dowr
remaining
in
the
coffer
of
her
friends
from
whom
we
thought
it
meet
to
hide
our
love
till
time
had
made
them
for
us
but
it
chances
the
stealth
of
our
most
mutual
entertainment
with
character
too
gross
is
writ
on
juliet
lucio
with
child
perhaps
claudio
unhappily
even
so
and
the
new
deputy
now
for
the
duke
whether
it
be
the
fault
and
glimpse
of
newness
or
whether
that
the
body
public
be
a
horse
whereon
the
governor
doth
ride
who
newly
in
the
seat
that
it
may
know
he
can
command
lets
it
straight
feel
the
spur
whether
the
tyranny
be
in
his
place
or
in
his
eminence
that
fills
it
up
i
stagger
in
but
this
new
governor
awakes
me
all
the
enrolled
penalties
which
have
like
unscourd
armour
hung
by
th
wall
so
long
that
nineteen
zodiacs
have
gone
round
and
none
of
them
been
worn
and
for
a
name
now
puts
the
drowsy
and
neglected
act
freshly
on
me
tis
surely
for
a
name
lucio
i
warrant
it
is
and
thy
head
stands
so
tickle
on
thy
shoulders
that
a
milkmaid
if
she
be
in
love
may
sigh
it
off
send
after
the
duke
and
appeal
to
him
claudio
i
have
done
so
but
hes
not
to
be
found
i
prithee
lucio
do
me
this
kind
service
this
day
my
sister
should
the
cloister
enter
and
there
receive
her
approbation
acquaint
her
with
the
danger
of
my
state
implore
her
in
my
voice
that
she
make
friends
to
the
strict
deputy
bid
herself
assay
him
i
have
great
hope
in
that
for
in
her
youth
there
is
a
prone
and
speechless
dialect
such
as
move
men
beside
she
hath
prosperous
art
when
she
will
play
with
reason
and
discourse
and
well
she
can
persuade
lucio
i
pray
she
may
as
well
for
the
encouragement
of
the
like
which
else
would
stand
under
grievous
imposition
as
for
the
enjoying
of
thy
life
who
i
would
be
sorry
should
be
thus
foolishly
lost
at
a
game
of
ticktack
ill
to
her
claudio
i
thank
you
good
friend
lucio
lucio
within
two
hours
claudio
come
officer
away

thomas

no
holy
father
throw
away
that
thought
believe
not
that
the
dribbling
dart
of
love
can
pierce
a
complete
bosom
why
i
desire
thee
to
give
me
secret
harbour
hath
a
purpose
more
grave
and
wrinkled
than
the
aims
and
ends
of
burning
youth
friar
may
your
grace
speak
of
it
duke
my
holy
sir
none
better
knows
than
you
how
i
have
ever
lovd
the
life
removed
and
held
in
idle
price
to
haunt
assemblies
where
youth
and
cost
a
witless
bravery
keeps
i
have
deliverd
to
lord
angelo
a
man
of
stricture
and
firm
abstinence
my
absolute
power
and
place
here
in
vienna
and
he
supposes
me
travelld
to
poland
for
so
i
have
strewd
it
in
the
common
ear
and
so
it
is
received
now
pious
sir
you
will
demand
of
me
why
i
do
this
friar
gladly
my
lord
duke
we
have
strict
statutes
and
most
biting
laws
the
needful
bits
and
curbs
to
headstrong
steeds
which
for
this
fourteen
years
we
have
let
slip
even
like
an
oergrown
lion
in
a
cave
that
goes
not
out
to
prey
now
as
fond
fathers
having
bound
up
the
threatning
twigs
of
birch
only
to
stick
it
in
their
childrens
sight
for
terror
not
to
use
in
time
the
rod
becomes
more
mockd
than
feard
so
our
decrees
dead
to
infliction
to
themselves
are
dead
and
liberty
plucks
justice
by
the
nose
the
baby
beats
the
nurse
and
quite
athwart
goes
all
decorum
friar
it
rested
in
your
grace
to
unloose
this
tiedup
justice
when
you
pleasd
and
it
in
you
more
dreadful
would
have
seemd
than
in
lord
angelo
duke
i
do
fear
too
dreadful
sith
twas
my
fault
to
give
the
people
scope
twould
be
my
tyranny
to
strike
and
gall
them
for
what
i
bid
them
do
for
we
bid
this
be
done
when
evil
deeds
have
their
permissive
pass
and
not
the
punishment
therefore
indeed
my
father
i
have
on
angelo
imposd
the
office
who
may
in
th
ambush
of
my
name
strike
home
and
yet
my
nature
never
in
the
fight
to
do
in
slander
and
to
behold
his
sway
i
will
as
twere
a
brother
of
your
order
visit
both
prince
and
people
therefore
i
prithee
supply
me
with
the
habit
and
instruct
me
how
i
may
formally
in

bear

like

true

reasons
for

at

this

lord
angelo

scarce
confesses

lapwing
and
to
jest

far
from

play
with
all
virgins
so
i
hold
you
as
a
thing
enskied
and
sainted
by
your
renouncement
an
immortal
spirit
and
to

this
is
the
point
the
duke
is
very
strangely
gone
from
hence
bore
many
gentlemen
myself
being
one
in
hand
and
hope
of
action
but
we
do
learn
by
those
that
know
the
very
nerves
of
state
his
givingsout
were
of
an
infinite
distance
from
his
truemeant
design
upon
his
place
and
with
full
line
of
his
authority
governs
lord
angelo
a
man
whose
blood
is
very
snowbroth
one
who
never
feels
the
wanton
stings
and
motions
of
the
sense
but
doth
rebate
and
blunt
his
natural
edge
with
profits
of
the
mind
study
and
fast
he
to
give
fear
to
use
and
liberty
which
have
for
long
run
by
the
hideous
law
as
mice
by
lions
hath
pickd
out
an
act
under
whose
heavy
sense
your
brothers
life
falls
into
forfeit
he
arrests
him
on
it
and
follows
close
the
rigour
of
the
statute
to
make
him
an
example
all
hope
is
gone
unless
you
have
the
grace
by
your
fair
prayer
to
soften
angelo
and
thats
my
pith
of
business
twixt
you
and
your
poor
brother
isabella
doth
he
so
seek
his
life
lucio
has
censurd
him
already
and
as
i
hear
the
provost
hath
a
warrant
for
his
execution
isabella
alas
what
poor
abilitys
in
me
to
do
him
good
lucio
assay
the
powr
you
have
isabella
my
power
alas
i
doubt
lucio
our
doubts
are
traitors
and
make
us
lose
the
good
we
oft
might
win
by
fearing
to
attempt
go
to
lord
angelo
and
let
him
learn
to
know
when
maidens
sue
men
give
like
gods
but
when
they
weep
and
kneel
all
their
petitions
are
as
freely
theirs
as
they
themselves
would
owe
them
isabella
ill
see
what
i
can
do

angelo
we
must
not
make
a
scarecrow
of
the

setting
it
up
to
fear
the
birds
of
prey
and
let
it
keep
one
shape
till
custom
make
it
their
perch
and
not
their
terror
escalus
ay
but
yet
let
us
be
keen
and
rather
cut
a
little
than
fall
and
bruise
to
death

this
gentleman
whom
i
would
save
had
a
most
noble
father
let
but
your
honour

be
most
strait

the
working
of
your
own
affections
had
time
coherd
with
place
or
place
with
wishing
or
that
the
resolute
acting
of
our
blood
could
have
attaind
th
effect
of
your
own
purpose
whether
you
had
not
sometime
in
your
life
errd
in
this
point
which
now
you
censure
him

pulld
the

open
made
to
justice
that
justice
seizes
what

the
laws
that
thieves
do
pass
on
thieves

very
pregnant
the
jewel
that
we
find
we
stoop
and
taket
because
we
see
it
but
what
we
do
not
see
we
tread
upon
and
never
think
of
it
you
may
not
so
extenuate
his
offence
for

have
had
such
faults
but

tell
me

my
death

right
that
answering

your

isabella
so
you
must
be
the
first
that
gives
this

and
he
that
suffers
o

is
excellent
to
have
a
giants
strength
but
it
is
tyrannous
to
use
it
like
a

lucio
to

thats
well

isabella
could
great

nothing

merciful
heaven
thou
rather
with
thy
sharp

sulphurous

proud

dressd
in
a

most
ignorant
of

his

such
fantastic

sir
believe

angelo
i
talk

i

i
now
the

take

as
a

it

angelo
pleasd

nay
but
hear
me
your

pursues
not
mine
either
you
are
ignorant
or
seem
so
craftily
and
thats
not
good
isabella
let
me
be
ignorant
and
in
nothing
good
but
graciously
to
know
i
am
no
better
angelo
thus
wisdom
wishes
to

most
bright
when
it
doth
tax
itself
as
these
black
masks
proclaim
an
enshielded
beauty
ten
times
louder
than
beauty

but
mark
me
to
be

plain
ill
speak
more
gross
your
brother
is
to
die
isabella
so
angelo
and
his
offence
is
so
as
it
appears
accountant
to
the
law
upon
that
pain
isabella
true
angelo
admit
no
other
way
to
save
his
life
as
i
subscribe
not
that
nor
any
other
but
in
the
loss
of
question
that
you
his
sister
finding
yourself
desird
of
such
a
person
whose
credit
with
the
judge
or
own
great
place
could
fetch
your
brother
from
the
manacles
of
the
allbinding
law
and
that
there
were
no
earthly
mean
to
save
him
but
that
either
you
must
lay
down
the
treasures
of
your
body
to
this
supposed
or
else
to
let
him
suffer
what
would
you
do
isabella
as
much
for
my
poor
brother
as
myself
that
is
were
i
under
the
terms
of
death
th
impression
of
keen
whips
id
wear
as
rubies
and
strip
myself
to
death
as
to
a
bed
that
longing
have
been
sick
for
ere
id
yield
my
body
up
to
shame
angelo
then
must
your
brother
die
isabella
and
twere
the
cheaper
way
better
it
were
a
brother
died
at
once
than
that
a
sister
by
redeeming
him
should
die
for
ever
angelo
were
not
you
then
as
cruel
as
the
sentence
that
you
have
slanderd
so
isabella
ignominy
in
ransom
and
free
pardon
are
of
two
houses
lawful
mercy
is
nothing
kin
to
foul
redemption
angelo
you
seemd
of
late
to
make
the
law
a
tyrant
and
rather
provd
the
sliding
of
your
brother
a
merriment
than
a
vice
isabella
o
pardon
me
my
lord
it
oft
falls
out
to

i
hate

credulous

false

think
it
well

most
good
most
good
indeed
lord
angelo
having
affairs
to
heaven
intends
you
for
his
swift
ambassador
where
you
shall
be
an
everlasting
leiger
therefore
your
best
appointment
make
with
speed
tomorrow
you
set
on
claudio
is
there
no
remedy
isabella
none
but
such
remedy
as
to
save
a
head
to
cleave
a
heart
in
twain
claudio
but
is
there
any
isabella
yes
brother
you
may
live
there
is
a
devilish
mercy
in
the
judge
if
youll
implore
it
that
will
free
your
life
but
fetter
you
till
death
claudio
perpetual
durance
isabella
ay
just
perpetual
durance
a
restraint
though
all
the
worlds
vastidity
you
had
to
a
determind
scope
claudio
but
in
what
nature
isabella
in
such
a
one
as
you
consenting
tot
would
bark
your
honour
from
that
trunk
you
bear
and
leave
you
naked
claudio
let
me
know
the
point
isabella
o
i
do
fear
thee
claudio
and
i
quake
lest
thou
a
feverous
life
shouldst
entertain
and
six
or
seven
winters
more
respect
than
a
perpetual
honour
darst
thou
die
the
sense
of
death
is
most
in
apprehension
and
the
poor
beetle
that
we
tread
upon
in
corporal
sufferance
finds
a
pang
as
great
as
when
a
giant
dies
claudio
why
give
you
me
this
shame
think
you
i
can
a
resolution
fetch
from
flowry
tenderness
if
i
must
die
i
will
encounter
darkness
as
a
bride
and
hug
it
in
mine
arms
isabella
there
spake
my
brother
there
my
fathers
grave
did
utter
forth
a
voice
yes
thou
must
die
thou
art
too
noble
to
conserve
a
life
in
base
appliances
this
outwardsainted
deputy
whose
settled
visage
and
deliberate
word
nips
youth
i
th
head
and
follies
doth
enew
as
falcon
doth
the
fowl
is
yet
a
devil
his
filth
within
being
cast
he
would
appear
a
pond
as
deep
as
hell
claudio
the
precise
angelo
isabella
o
tis
the
cunning
livery
of
hell
the
damnedst
body
to
invest
and
cover
in
precise
guards
dost
thou
think
claudio
if
i
would
yield
him
my
virginity
thou
mightst
be
freed
claudio
o
heavens
it
cannot
be
isabella
yes
he
would
givet
thee
from
this
rank
offence
so
to
offend
him
still
this
nights
the
time
that
i
should
do
what
i
abhor
to
name
or
else
thou
diest
tomorrow
claudio
thou
shalt
not
dot
isabella
o
were
it
but
my
life
id
throw
it
down
for
your
deliverance
as
frankly
as
a
pin
claudio
thanks
dear
isabel
isabella
be
ready
claudio
for
your
death
tomorrow
claudio
yes
has
he
affections
in
him
that
thus
can
make
him
bite
the
law
by
th
nose
when
he
would
force
it
sure
it
is
no
sin
or
of
the
deadly
seven
it
is
the
least
isabella
which
is
the
least
claudio
if
it
were
damnable
he
being
so
wise
why
would
he
for
the
momentary
trick
be
perdurably
find
o
isabel
isabella
what
says
my
brother
claudio
death
is
a
fearful
thing
isabella
and
shamed
life
a
hateful
claudio
ay
but
to
die
and
go
we
know
not
where
to
lie
in
cold
obstruction
and
to
rot
this
sensible
warm
motion
to
become
a
kneaded
clod
and
the
delighted
spirit
to
bathe
in
fiery
floods
or
to
reside
in
thrilling
region
of
thickribbed
ice
to
be
imprisond
in
the
viewless
winds
and
blown
with
restless
violence
round
about
the
pendent
world
or
to
be
worse
than
worst
of
those
that
lawless
and
incertain
thought
imagine
howling
tis
too
horrible
the
weariest
and
most
loathed
worldly
life
that
age
ache
penury
and
imprisonment
can
lay
on
nature
is
a
paradise
to
what
we
fear
of
death
isabella
alas
alas
claudio
sweet
sister
let
me
live
what
sin
you
do
to
save
a
brothers
life
nature
dispenses
with
the
deed
so
far
that
it
becomes
a
virtue
isabella
o
you
beast
o
faithless
coward
o
dishonest
wretch
wilt
thou
be
made
a
man
out
of
my
vice

kind
of
incest

duke

a
word
young

but
one
word
isabella
what
is
your
will
duke
might
you
dispense
with
your
leisure
i
would
by
and
by
have
some
speech
with

satisfaction
i
would
require
is
likewise
your

benefit
isabella

no
superfluous
leisure
my
stay
must
be
stolen
out
of
other
affairs
but
i
will
attend
you
awhile
walks
apart
duke
son
i
have
overheard
what
hath
passd
between
you
and
your
sister
angelo
had
never
the
purpose
to
corrupt
her
only
he
hath
made
an
assay
of
her
virtue
to
practise
his
judgment
with
the
disposition
of
natures
she
having
the
truth
of
honour
in
her
hath
made
him
that
gracious
denial
which
he
is
most
glad
to
receive
i
am
confessor
to
angelo
and
i
know
this
to
be
true
therefore
prepare
yourself
to
death
do
not
satisfy
your
resolution
with
hopes
that
are
fallible
tomorrow
you
must
die
go
to
your
knees
and
make
ready
claudio
let
me
ask
my
sister
pardon
i
am
so
out
of
love
with
life
that
i
will
sue
to
be
rid
of
it
duke
hold
you
there
farewell
exit
claudio
provost
a
word
with
you

reenter
provost

provost
whats
your
will
father
duke
that
now
you
are
come
you
will
be
gone
leave
me
a
while
with
the
maid
my
mind
promises
with
my
habit

her
by
my
company
provost
in
good
time



























exit
provost
duke
the
hand
that
hath
made
you
fair
hath
made
you
good
the
goodness
that
is
cheap
in
beauty
makes
beauty
brief
in
goodness
but
grace
being
the
soul
of
your
complexion
shall
keep
the
body
of
it
ever
fair
the
assault
that
angelo
hath
made
to
you
fortune
hath
conveyd
to
my
understanding
and
but
that
frailty
hath
examples
for
his
falling
i
should
wonder
at
angelo
how
will
you
do
to
content
this
substitute
and
to
save
your
brother
isabella
i
am
now
going
to
resolve
him
i
had
rather
my
brother
die
by
the
law
than
my
son
should
be
unlawfully
born
but
o
how
much
is
the
good
duke
deceivd
in
angelo
if
ever
he
return
and
i
can
speak
to
him
i
will
open
my
lips
in
vain
or
discover
his
government
duke
that
shall
not
be
much
amiss
yet
as
the
matter
now
stands
he
will
avoid
your
accusation
he
made
trial
of
you
only
therefore
fasten
your
ear
on
my
advisings
to
the
love
i
have
in
doing
good
a
remedy
presents
itself
i
do
make
myself
believe
that
you
may
most
uprighteously
do
a
poor
wronged
lady
a
merited
benefit
redeem
your
brother
from
the
angry
law
do
no
stain
to
your
own
gracious
person
and
much
please
the
absent
duke
if
peradventure
he
shall
ever
return
to
have
hearing
of
this
business
isabella
let
me
hear
you
speak
farther
i
have
spirit
to
do
anything
that
appears
not
foul
in
the
truth
of
my
spirit
duke
virtue
is
bold
and
goodness
never
fearful
have
you
not
heard
speak
of
mariana
the
sister
of
frederick
the
great
soldier
who
miscarried
at
sea
isabella
i
have
heard
of
the
lady
and
good
words
went
with
her
name
duke
she
should
this
angelo
have
married
was
affianced
to
her
by
oath
and
the
nuptial
appointed
between
which
time
of
the
contract
and
limit
of
the
solemnity
her
brother
frederick
was
wreckd
at
sea
having
in
that
perished
vessel
the
dowry
of
his
sister
but
mark
how
heavily
this
befell
to
the
poor
gentlewoman
there
she
lost
a
noble
and
renowned
brother
in
his
love
toward
her
ever
most
kind
and
natural
with
him
the
portion
and
sinew
of
her
fortune
her
marriagedowry
with
both
her
combinate
husband
this
wellseeming
angelo
isabella
can
this
be
so
did
angelo
so
leave
her
duke
left
her
in
her
tears
and
dried
not
one
of
them
with
his
comfort
swallowed
his
vows
whole
pretending
in
her
discoveries
of
dishonour
in
few
bestowd
her
on
her
own
lamentation
which
she
yet
wears
for
his
sake
and
he
a
marble
to
her
tears
is
washed
with
them
but
relents
not
isabella
what
a
merit
were
it
in
death
to
take
this
poor
maid
from
the
world
what
corruption
in
this
life
that
it
will
let
this
man
live
but
how
out
of
this
can
she
avail
duke
it
is
a
rupture
that
you
may
easily
heal
and
the
cure
of
it
not
only
saves
your
brother
but
keeps
you
from
dishonour
in
doing
it
isabella
show
me
how
good
father
duke
this
forenamed
maid
hath
yet
in
her
the
continuance
of
her
first
affection
his
unjust
unkindness
that
in
all
reason
should
have
quenched
her
love
hath
like
an
impediment
in
the
current
made
it
more
violent
and
unruly
go
you
to
angelo
answer
his
requiring
with
a
plausible
obedience
agree
with
his
demands
to
the
point
only
refer
yourself
to
this
advantage
first
that
your
stay
with
him
may
not
be
long
that
the
time
may
have
all
shadow
and
silence
in
it
and
the
place
answer
to
convenience
this
being
granted
in
course
and
now
follows
all
we
shall
advise
this
wronged
maid
to
stead
up
your
appointment
go
in
your
place
if
the
encounter
acknowledge
itself
hereafter
it
may
compel
him
to
her
recompense
and
here
by
this
is
your
brother
saved
your
honour
untainted
the
poor
mariana
advantaged
and
the
corrupt
deputy
scaled
the
maid
will
i
frame
and
make
fit
for
his
attempt
if
you
think
well
to
carry
this
as
you
may
the
doubleness
of
the
benefit
defends
the
deceit
from
reproof
what
think
you
of
it
isabella
the
image
of
it
gives
me
content
already
and
i
trust
it
will
grow
to
a
most
prosperous
perfection

lies
much
in
your
holding
up

pompey

what
news
friar
of
the
duke
duke
i
know
none
can
you
tell
me
of
any
lucio
some
say
he
is
with
the
emperor
of
russia
other
some
he
is
in
rome
but
where
is
he
think
you
duke
i
know
not
where
but
wheresoever
i
wish
him
well
lucio
it
was
a
mad
fantastical
trick
of
him
to
steal
from
the
state
and
usurp
the
beggary
he
was
never
born
to
lord
angelo
dukes
it
well
in
his
absence
he
puts
transgression
tot
duke
he
does
well
int
lucio
a
little
more
lenity
to
lechery
would
do
no
harm
in
him
something
too
crabbed
that
way
friar
duke
it
is
too
general
a
vice
and
severity
must
cure
it
lucio
yes
in
good
sooth
the
vice
is
of
a
great
kindred
it
is
well
allied
but
it
is
impossible
to
extirp
it
quite
friar
till
eating
and
drinking
be
put
down
they
say
this
angelo
was
not
made
by
man
and
woman
after
this
downright
way
of
creation
is
it
true
think
you
duke
how
should
he
be
made
then
lucio
some
report
a
seamaid
spawnd
him
some
that
he
was
begot
between
two
stockfishes
but
it
is
certain
that
when
he
makes
water
his
urine
is
congeald
ice
that
i
know
to
be
true
and
he
is
a
motion
generative
thats
infallible
duke
you
are
pleasant
sir
and
speak
apace
lucio
why
what
a
ruthless
thing
is
this
in
him
for
the
rebellion
of
a
codpiece
to
take
away
the
life
of
a
man
would
the
duke
that
is
absent
have
done
this
ere
he
would
have
hangd
a
man
for
the
getting
a
hundred
bastards
he
would
have
paid
for
the
nursing
a
thousand
he
had
some
feeling
of
the
sport
he
knew
the
service
and
that
instructed
him
to
mercy
duke
i
never
heard
the
absent
duke
much
detected
for
women
he
was
not
inclind
that
way
lucio
o
sir
you
are
deceivd
duke
tis
not
possible
lucio
who
not
the
duke
yes
your
beggar
of
fifty
and
his
use
was
to
put
a
ducat
in
her
clackdish
the
duke
had
crotchets
in
him
he
would
be
drunk
too
that
let
me
inform
you
duke
you
do
him
wrong
surely
lucio
sir
i
was
an
inward
of
his
a
shy
fellow
was
the
duke
and
i
believe
i
know
the
cause
of
his
withdrawing
duke
what
i
prithee
might
be
the
cause
lucio
no
pardon
tis
a
secret
must
be
lockd
within
the
teeth
and
the
lips
but
this
i
can
let
you
understand
the
greater
file
of
the
subject
held
the
duke
to
be
wise
duke
wise
why
no
question
but
he
was
lucio
a
very
superficial
ignorant
unweighing
fellow
duke
either
this
is
envy
in
you
folly
or
mistaking
the
very
stream
of
his
life
and
the
business
he
hath
helmed
must
upon
a
warranted
need
give
him
a
better
proclamation
let
him
be
but
testimonied
in
his
own
bringingsforth
and
he
shall
appear
to
the
envious
a
scholar
a
statesman
and
a
soldier
therefore
you
speak
unskilfully
or
if
your
knowledge
be
more
it
is
much
darkned
in
your
malice
lucio
sir
i
know
him
and
i
love
him
duke
love
talks
with
better
knowledge
and
knowledge
with
dearer
love
lucio
come
sir
i
know
what
i
know
duke
i
can
hardly
believe
that
since
you
know
not
what
you
speak
but
if
ever
the
duke
return
as
our
prayers
are
he
may
let
me
desire
you
to
make
your
answer
before
him
if
it
be
honest
you
have
spoke
you
have
courage
to
maintain
it
i
am
bound
to
call
upon
you
and
i
pray
you
your
name
lucio
sir
my
name
is
lucio
well
known
to
the
duke
duke
he
shall
know
you
better
sir
if
i
may
live
to
report
you
lucio
i
fear
you
not
duke
o
you
hope
the
duke
will
return
no
more
or
you
imagine
me
too
unhurtful
an
opposite
but
indeed
i
can
do
you
little
harm
youll
forswear
this
again
lucio
ill
be
hangd
first
thou
art
deceivd
in
me
friar
but
no
more
of
this
canst
thou
tell
if
claudio
die
tomorrow
or
no
duke
why
should
he
die
sir
lucio
why
for
filling
a
bottle
with
a
tundish
i
would
the
duke
we
talk
of
were
returnd
again
this
ungeniturd
agent
will
unpeople
the
province
with
continency
sparrows
must
not
build
in
his
houseeaves
because
they
are
lecherous
the
duke
yet
would
have
dark
deeds
darkly
answered
he
would
never
bring
them
to
light
would
he
were
returnd
marry
this
claudio
is
condemned
for
untrussing
farewell
good
friar
i
prithee
pray
for
me
the
duke
i
say
to
thee
again
would
eat
mutton
on
fridays
hes
not
past
it
yet
and
i
say
to
thee
he
would
mouth
with
a
beggar
though
she
smelt
brown
bread
and
garlic
say
that
i
said
so
farewell

this

you

of
what
disposition
was
the
duke
escalus
one
that
above
all
other
strifes
contended
especially
to
know
himself
duke
what
pleasure
was
he
given
to

rather
rejoicing
to

another
merry
than
merry
at
anything
which
professd
to
make
him
rejoice

professes
to
have
received
no
sinister
measure
from
his
judge
but
most
willingly
humbles
himself
to
the
determination
of
justice
yet
had
he
framed
to
himself
by
the
instruction
of
his
frailty
many
deceiving
promises
of
life
which
i
by
my
good
leisure
have
discredited
to
him
and
now
he
is
resolvd
to
die

this
is
his

for
which
the
pardoner

in
hence
hath
offence
his
quick
celerity
when
it

borne
in
high

when

makes

mercys
so
extended

belike
thinking
me
remiss
in

with
this
unwonted
puttingon
methinks
strangely
for
he
hath
not
usd
it
before
duke
pray
you
lets
hear
provost
reads
whatsoever
you
may
hear
to
the
contrary
let
claudio
be
executed
by
four
of
the
clock
and
in
the
afternoon
barnardine
for
my
better
satisfaction
let
me
have
claudios
head
sent
me
by
five
let
this
be
duly
performed
with
a
thought
that
more
depends
on
it
than
we
must
yet
deliver
thus
fail
not
to
do
your
office
as
you
will
answer
it
at
your
peril
what
say
you
to
this
sir
duke
what
is
that
barnardine
who
is
to
be
executed
in
th
afternoon
provost
a
bohemian
born
but
here
nursd
up
and
bred
one
that
is
a
prisoner
nine
years
old
duke
how
came
it
that
the
absent
duke
had
not
either
deliverd
him
to
his
liberty
or
executed
him
i
have
heard
it
was
ever
his
manner
to
do
so
provost
his
friends
still
wrought
reprieves
for
him
and
indeed
his
fact
till
now
in
the
government
of
lord
angelo
came
not
to
an
undoubted
proof
duke
it
is
now
apparent
provost
most
manifest
and
not
denied
by
himself
duke
hath
he
borne
himself
penitently
in
prison
how
seems
he
to
be
touchd
provost
a
man
that
apprehends
death
no
more
dreadfully
but
as
a
drunken
sleep
careless
reckless
and
fearless
of
whats
past
present
or
to
come
insensible
of
mortality
and
desperately
mortal
duke
he
wants
advice
provost
he
will
hear
none
he
hath
evermore
had
the
liberty
of
the
prison
give
him
leave
to
escape
hence
he
would
not
drunk
many
times
a
day
if
not
many
days
entirely
drunk
we
have
very
oft
awakd
him
as
if
to
carry
him
to
execution
and
showd
him
a
seeming
warrant
for
it
it
hath
not
moved
him
at
all
duke
more
of
him
anon
there
is
written
in
your
brow
provost
honesty
and
constancy
if
i
read
it
not
truly
my
ancient
skill
beguiles
me
but
in
the
boldness
of
my
cunning
i
will
lay
myself
in
hazard
claudio
whom
here
you
have
warrant
to
execute
is
no
greater
forfeit
to
the
law
than
angelo
who
hath
sentencd
him
to
make
you
understand
this
in
a
manifested
effect
i
crave
but
four
days
respite
for
the
which
you
are
to
do
me
both
a
present
and
a
dangerous
courtesy
provost
pray
sir
in
what
duke
in
the
delaying
death
provost
alack
how
may
i
do
it
having
the
hour
limited
and
an
express
command
under
penalty
to
deliver
his
head
in
the
view
of
angelo
i
may
make
my
case
as
claudios
to
cross
this
in
the
smallest
duke
by
the
vow
of
mine
order
i
warrant
you
if
my
instructions
may
be
your
guide
let
this
barnardine
be
this
morning
executed
and
his
head
borne
to
angelo
provost
angelo
hath
seen
them
both
and
will
discover
the
favour
duke
o
deaths
a
great
disguiser
and
you
may
add
to
it
shave
the
head
and
tie
the
beard
and
say
it
was
the
desire
of
the
penitent
to
be
so
bard
before
his
death
you
know
the
course
is
common
if
anything
fall
to
you
upon
this
more
than
thanks
and
good
fortune
by
the
saint
whom
i
profess
i
will
plead
against
it
with
my
life
provost
pardon
me
good
father
it
is
against
my
oath
duke
were
you
sworn
to
the
duke
or
to
the
deputy
provost
to
him
and
to
his
substitutes
duke
you
will
think
you
have
made
no
offence
if
the
duke
avouch
the
justice
of
your
dealing
provost
but
what
likelihood
is
in
that
duke
not
a
resemblance
but
a
certainty
yet
since
i
see
you
fearful
that
neither
my
coat
integrity
nor
persuasion
can
with
ease
attempt
you
i
will
go
further
than
i
meant
to
pluck
all
fears
out
of
you
look
you
sir
here
is
the
hand
and
seal
of
the
duke
you
know
the
character
i
doubt
not
and
the
signet
is
not
strange
to
you
provost
i
know
them
both
duke
the
contents
of
this
is
the
return
of
the
duke
you
shall
anon
overread
it
at
your
pleasure
where
you
shall
find
within
these
two
days
he
will
be
here
this
is
a
thing
that
angelo
knows
not
for
he
this
very
day
receives
letters
of
strange
tenour
perchance
of
the
dukes
death
perchance
entering
into
some
monastery
but
by
chance
nothing
of
what
is
writ
look
th
unfolding
star
calls
up
the
shepherd
put
not
yourself
into
amazement
how
these
things
should
be
all
difficulties
are
but
easy
when
they
are
known
call
your
executioner
and
off
with
barnardines
head
i
will
give
him
a
present
shrift
and
advise
him
for
a
better
place
yet
you
are
amazd

this
shall
absolutely
resolve

strange
isabella
most
strange

yet
most
truly
will
i
speak
that
angelos
forsworn
is
it
not

ist
not
strange
that
angelo
is
an
adulterous
thief
an
hypocrite
a
virginviolator
is
it
not
strange
and
strange
duke
nay
it
is
ten
times
strange
isabella
it
is
not
truer
he
is
angelo
than
this
is
all
as
true
as
it
is

of

away
with
her
poor
soul
she
speaks
this
in
th
infirmity
of

isabella
o
prince
i
conjure
thee
as
thou
believst
there
is
another
comfort
than
this
world
that
thou
neglect
me
not
with
that
opinion
that
i
am
touchd
with
madness
make
not
impossible
that
which
but
seems
unlike
tis
not
impossible
but
one
the
wickedst
caitiff
on
the
ground
may
seem
as
shy
as
grave
as
just
as
absolute
as
angelo
even
so
may
angelo
in
all
his
dressings
characts
titles
forms
be
an
archvillain
believe
it
royal
prince
if
he
be
less
hes
nothing
but
hes
more
had
i
more
name
for
badness
duke
by
mine
honesty
if
she
be
mad
as
i
believe
no
other
her
madness
hath
the
oddest
frame
of
sense
such
a
dependency
of
thing
on
thing
as
eer
i
heard
in
madness
isabella
o
gracious
duke
harp
not
on
that
nor
do
not
banish
reason
for
inequality
but
let
your
reason
serve
to
make
the
truth
appear
where
it
seems
hid
and
hide
the
false
seems
true
duke
many
that
are
not
mad
have
sure
more
lack
of
reason
what
would
you
say
isabella
i
am
the
sister
of
one
claudio
condemnd
upon
the
act
of
fornication
to
lose
his
head
condemnd
by
angelo
i
in
probation
of
a
sisterhood
was
sent
to
by
my
brother
one
lucio
as
then
the
messenger
lucio
thats
i
ant
like
your
grace
i
came
to
her
from
claudio
and
desird
her
to
try
her
gracious
fortune
with
lord
angelo
for
her
poor
brothers
pardon
isabella
thats
he
indeed
duke
you
were
not
bid
to
speak
lucio
no
my
good
lord
nor
wishd
to
hold
my
peace
duke
i
wish
you
now
then
pray
you
take
note
of
it
and
when
you
have
a
business
for
yourself
pray
heaven
you
then
be
perfect
lucio
i
warrant
your
honour
duke
the
warrants
for
yourself
take
heed
tot
isabella
this
gentleman
told
somewhat
of
my
tale
lucio
right
duke
it
may
be
right
but
you
are
i
the
wrong
to
speak
before
your
time
proceed
isabella
i
went
to
this
pernicious
caitiff
deputy
duke
thats
somewhat
madly
spoken
isabella
pardon
it
the
phrase
is
to
the
matter
duke
mended
again
the
matter
proceed
isabella
in
brief
to
set
the
needless
process
by
how
i
persuaded
how
i
prayd
and
kneeld
how
he
refelld
me
and
how
i
replied
for
this
was
of
much
length
the
vile
conclusion
i
now
begin
with
grief
and
shame
to
utter
he
would
not
but
by
gift
of
my
chaste
body
to
his
concupiscible
intemperate
lust
release
my
brother
and
after
much
debatement
my
sisterly
remorse
confutes
mine
honour
and
i
did
yield
to
him
but
the
next
morn
betimes
his
purpose
surfeiting
he
sends
a
warrant
for
my
poor
brothers
head
duke
this
is
most
likely
isabella
o
that
it
were
as
like
as
it
is
true
duke
by
heaven
fond
wretch
thou
knowst
not
what
thou
speakst
or
else
thou
art
subornd
against
his
honour
in
hateful
practice
first
his
integrity
stands
without
blemish
next
it
imports
no
reason
that
with
such
vehemency
he
should
pursue
faults
proper
to
himself
if
he
had
so
offended
he
would
have
weighd
thy
brother
by
himself
and
not
have
cut
him
off
some
one
hath
set
you
on
confess
the
truth
and
say
by
whose
advice
thou
camst
here
to
complain
isabella
and
is
this
all
then
o
you
blessed
ministers
above
keep
me
in
patience
and
with
ripened
time
unfold
the
evil
which
is
here
wrapt
up
in
countenance
heaven
shield
your
grace
from
woe
as
i
thus
wrongd
hence
unbelieved
go

with
her
shall
we
thus
permit
a
blasting
and
a
scandalous
breath
to
fall
on
him

needs
must
be
a
practice
who

very
scurvy

stood
by
my

and
i
have
heard
your
royal
ear

this
woman
most
wrongfully
accusd
your
substitute
who
is
as
free
from
touch
or
soil
with
her
as
she
from
one
ungot
duke
we
did
believe
no
less
know
you
that
friar
lodowick
that
she
speaks
of
peter
i
know
him
for
a
man
divine
and
holy
not
scurvy
nor
a
temporary
meddler
as
hes
reported

man
that

lord
most
villainously
believe
it
peter

at
this
instant
he
is
sick
my
lord
of
a
strange
fever
upon
his
mere
request
being
come
to
knowledge
that
there
was
complaint
intended
gainst
lord
angelo
came
i
hither
to
speak
as
from
his
mouth
what
he
doth
know
is
true
and
false
and
what
he
with
his
oath
and
all
probation
will
make
up
full
clear
whensoever
hes
convented
first
for
this
woman
to
justify
this
worthy
nobleman

vulgarly
and
personally
accusd
her
shall

was
disvalued
in
levity
since

scene
venice
and
portias
house
at
belmont


act
i
scene
i
venice
a
street

enter
antonio
salerio
and
solanio

antonio
in
sooth
i
know
not
why
i
am
so
sad
it
wearies
me
you
say
it
wearies
you
but
how
i
caught
it
found
it
or
came
by
it
what
stuff
tis
made
of
whereof
it
is
born
i
am
to
learn
and
such
a
wantwit
sadness
makes
of
me
that
i
have
much
ado
to
know
myself
salerio
your
mind
is
tossing
on
the
ocean
there
where
your
argosies
with
portly
sail
like
signiors
and
rich
burghers
on
the
flood
or
as
it
were
the
pageants
of
the
sea
do
overpeer
the
petty
traffickers
that
curtsy
to
them
do
them
reverence
as
they
fly
by
them
with
their
woven
wings
solanio
believe
me
sir
had
i
such
venture
forth
the
better
part
of
my
affections
would
be
with
my
hopes
abroad
i
should
be
still
plucking
the
grass
to
know
where
sits
the
wind
peering
in
maps
for
ports
and
piers
and
roads
and
every
object
that
might
make
me
fear
misfortune
to
my
ventures
out
of
doubt
would
make
me
sad
salerio
my
wind
cooling
my
broth
would
blow
me
to
an
ague
when
i
thought
what
harm
a
wind
too
great
might
do
at
sea
i
should
not
see
the
sandy
hourglass
run
but
i
should
think
of
shallows
and
of
flats
and
see
my
wealthy
andrew
dockd
in
sand
vailing
her
high
top
lower
than
her
ribs
to
kiss
her
burial
should
i
go
to
church
and
see
the
holy
edifice
of
stone
and
not
bethink
me
straight
of
dangerous
rocks
which
touching
but
my
gentle
vessels
side
would
scatter
all
her
spices
on
the
stream
enrobe
the
roaring
waters
with
my
silks
and
in
a
word
but
even
now
worth
this
and
now
worth
nothing
shall
i
have
the
thought
to
think
on
this
and
shall
i
lack
the
thought
that
such
a
thing
bechancd
would
make
me
sad
but
tell
not
me
i
know
antonio
is
sad
to
think
upon
his
merchandise
antonio
believe
me
no
i
thank
my
fortune
for
it
my
ventures
are
not
in
one
bottom
trusted
nor
to
one
place
nor
is
my
whole
estate
upon
the
fortune
of
this
present
year
therefore
my
merchandise
makes
me
not
sad
solanio
why
then
you
are
in
love
antonio
fie
fie
solanio
not
in
love
neither
then
let
us
say
you
are
sad
because
you
are
not
merry
and
twere
as
easy
for
you
to
laugh
and
leap
and
say
you
are
merry
because
you
are
not
sad
now
by
twoheaded
janus
nature
hath
framd
strange
fellows
in
her
time
some
that
will
evermore
peep
through
their
eyes
and
laugh
like
parrots
at
a
bagpiper
and
other
of
such
vinegar
aspect
that
theyll
not
show
their
teeth
in
way
of
smile
though
nestor
swear
the
jest
be
laughable

enter
bassanio
lorenzo
and
gratiano

here
comes
bassanio
your
most
noble
kinsman
gratiano
and
lorenzo
fare
ye
well
we
leave
you
now
with
better
company
salerio
i
would
have
stayd
till
i
had
made
you
merry
if
worthier
friends
had
not
prevented
me
antonio
your
worth
is
very
dear
in
my
regard
i
take
it
your
own
business
calls
on
you
and
you
embrace
th
occasion
to
depart
salerio
good
morrow
my
good
lords
bassanio
good
signiors
both
when
shall
we
laugh
say
when
you
grow
exceeding
strange
must
it
be
so
salerio
well
make
our
leisures
to
attend
on
yours
exeunt
salerio
and
solanio
lorenzo
my
lord
bassanio
since
you
have
found
antonio
we
two
will
leave
you
but
at
dinnertime
i
pray
you
have
in
mind
where
we
must
meet
bassanio
i
will
not
fail
you
gratiano
you
look
not
well
signior
antonio
you
have
too
much
respect
upon
the
world
they
lose
it
that
do
buy
it
with
much
care
believe
me
you
are
marvellously
changd
antonio
i
hold
the
world
but
as
the
world
gratiano
a
stage
where
every
man
must
play
a
part
and
mine
a
sad
one
gratiano
let
me
play
the
fool
with
mirth
and
laughter
let
old
wrinkles
come
and
let
my
liver
rather
heat
with
wine
than
my
heart
cool
with
mortifying
groans
why
should
a
man
whose
blood
is
warm
within
sit
like
his
grandsire
cut
in
alabaster
sleep
when
he
wakes
and
creep
into
the
jaundice
by
being
peevish
i
tell
thee
what
antonio
i
love
thee
and
tis
my
love
that
speaks
there
are
a
sort
of
men
whose
visages
do
cream
and
mantle
like
a
standing
pond
and
do
a
wilful
stillness
entertain
with
purpose
to
be
dressd
in
an
opinion
of
wisdom
gravity
profound
conceit
as
who
should
say
i
am
sir
oracle
and
when
i
ope
my
lips
let
no
dog
bark
o
my
antonio
i
do
know
of
these
that
therefore
only
are
reputed
wise
for
saying
nothing
when
i
am
very
sure
if
they
should
speak
would
almost
damn
those
ears
which
hearing
them
would
call
their
brothers
fools
ill
tell
thee
more
of
this
another
time
but
fish
not
with
this
melancholy
bait
for
this
fool
gudgeon
this
opinion
come
good
lorenzo
fare
ye
well
awhile
ill
end
my
exhortation
after
dinner
lorenzo
well
we
will
leave
you
then
till
dinnertime
i
must
be
one
of
these
same
dumb
wise
men
for
gratiano
never
lets
me
speak
gratiano
well
keep
me
company
but
two
years
moe
thou
shalt
not
know
the
sound
of
thine
own
tongue
antonio
fare
you
well
ill
grow
a
talker
for
this
gear
gratiano
thanks
i
faith
for
silence
is
only
commendable
in
a
neats
tongue
dried
and
a
maid
not
vendible
exeunt
gratiano
and
lorenzo
antonio
is
that
anything
now
bassanio
gratiano
speaks
an
infinite
deal
of
nothing
more
than
any
man
in
all
venice
his
reasons
are
as
two
grains
of
wheat
hid
in
two
bushels
of
chaff
you
shall
seek
all
day
ere
you
find
them
and
when
you
have
them
they
are
not
worth
the
search
antonio
well
tell
me
now
what
lady
is
the
same
to
whom
you
swore
a
secret
pilgrimage
that
you
today
promisd
to
tell
me
of
bassanio
tis
not
unknown
to
you
antonio
how
much
i
have
disabled
mine
estate
by
something
showing
a
more
swelling
port
than
my
faint
means
would
grant
continuance
nor
do
i
now
make
moan
to
be
abridgd
from
such
a
noble
rate
but
my
chief
care
is
to
come
fairly
off
from
the
great
debts
wherein
my
time
something
too
prodigal
hath
left
me
gagd
to
you
antonio
i
owe
the
most
in
money
and
in
love
and
from
your
love
i
have
a
warranty
to
unburden
all
my
plots
and
purposes
how
to
get
clear
of
all
the
debts
i
owe
antonio
i
pray
you
good
bassanio
let
me
know
it
and
if
it
stand
as
you
yourself
still
do
within
the
eye
of
honour
be
assurd
my
purse
my
person
my
extremest
means
lie
all
unlockd
to
your
occasions
bassanio
in
my
schooldays
when
i
had
lost
one
shaft
i
shot
his
fellow
of
the
selfsame
flight
the
selfsame
way
with
more
advised
watch
to
find
the
other
forth
and
by
adventuring
both
i
oft
found
both
i
urge
this
childhood
proof
because
what
follows
is
pure
innocence
i
owe
you
much
and
like
a
wilful
youth
that
which
i
owe
is
lost
but
if
you
please
to
shoot
another
arrow
that
self
way
which
you
did
shoot
the
first
i
do
not
doubt
as
i
will
watch
the
aim
or
to
find
both
or
bring
your
latter
hazard
back
again
and
thankfully
rest
debtor
for
the
first
antonio
you
know
me
well
and
herein
spend
but
time
to
wind
about
my
love
with
circumstance
and
out
of
doubt
you
do
me
now
more
wrong
in
making
question
of
my
uttermost
than
if
you
had
made
waste
of
all
i
have
then
do
but
say
to
me
what
i
should
do
that
in
your
knowledge
may
by
me
be
done
and
i
am
prest
unto
it
therefore
speak
bassanio
in
belmont
is
a
lady
richly
left
and
she
is
fair
and
fairer
than
that
word
of
wondrous
virtues
sometimes
from
her
eyes
i
did
receive
fair
speechless
messages
her
name
is
portia
nothing
undervalud
to
catos
daughter
brutus
portia
nor
is
the
wide
world
ignorant
of
her
worth
for
the
four
winds
blow
in
from
every
coast
renowned
suitors
and
her
sunny
locks
hang
on
her
temples
like
a
golden
fleece
which
makes
her
seat
of
belmont
colchos
strond
and
many
jasons
come
in
quest
of
her
o
my
antonio
had
i
but
the
means
to
hold
a
rival
place
with
one
of
them
i
have
a
mind
presages
me
such
thrift
that
i
should
questionless
be
fortunate
antonio
thou
knowst
that
all
my
fortunes
are
at
sea
neither
have
i
money
nor
commodity
to
raise
a
present
sum
therefore
go
forth
try
what
my
credit
can
in
venice
do
that
shall
be
rackd
even
to
the
uttermost
to
furnish
thee
to
belmont
to
fair
portia
go
presently
inquire
and
so
will
i
where
money
is
and
i
no
question
make
to
have
it
of
my
trust
or
for
my
sake















exeunt





scene
ii
belmont
portias
house

enter
portia
with
her
waitingwoman
nerissa

portia
by
my
troth
nerissa
my
little
body
is
aweary
of
this
great
world
nerissa
you
would
be
sweet
madam
if
your
miseries
were
in
the
same
abundance
as
your
good
fortunes
are
and
yet
for
aught
i
see
they
are
as
sick
that
surfeit
with
too
much
as
they
that
starve
with
nothing
it
is
no
mean
happiness
therefore
to
be
seated
in
the
mean
superfluity
come
sooner
by
white
hairs
but
competency
lives
longer
portia
good
sentences
and
well
pronouncd
nerissa
they
would
be
better
if
well
followed
portia
if
to
do
were
as
easy
as
to
know
what
were
good
to
do
chapels
had
been
churches
and
poor
mens
cottages
princes
palaces
it
is
a
good
divine
that
follows
his
own
instructions
i
can
easier
teach
twenty
what
were
good
to
be
done
than
to
be
one
of
the
twenty
to
follow
mine
own
teaching
the
brain
may
devise
laws
for
the
blood
but
a
hot
temper
leaps
oer
a
cold
decree
such
a
hare
is
madness
the
youth
to
skip
oer
the
meshes
of
good
counsel
the
cripple
but
this
reasoning
is
not
in
the
fashion
to
choose
me
a
husband
o
me
the
word
choose
i
may
neither
choose
who
i
would
nor
refuse
who
i
dislike
so
is
the
will
of
a
living
daughter
curbd
by
the
will
of
a
dead
father
is
it
not
hard
nerissa
that
i
cannot
choose
one
nor
refuse
none
nerissa
your
father
was
ever
virtuous
and
holy
men
at
their
death
have
good
inspirations
therefore
the
lottry
that
he
hath
devised
in
these
three
chests
of
gold
silver
and
lead
whereof
who
chooses
his
meaning
chooses
you
will
no
doubt
never
be
chosen
by
any
rightly
but
one
who
you
shall
rightly
love
but
what
warmth
is
there
in
your
affection
towards
any
of
these
princely
suitors
that
are
already
come
portia
i
pray
thee
overname
them
and
as
thou
namest
them
i
will
describe
them
and
according
to
my
description
level
at
my
affection
nerissa
first
there
is
the
neapolitan
prince
portia
ay
thats
a
colt
indeed
for
he
doth
nothing
but
talk
of
his
horse
and
he
makes
it
a
great
appropriation
to
his
own
good
parts
that
he
can
shoe
him
himself
i
am
much
afeard
my
lady
his
mother
playd
false
with
a
smith
nerissa
then
is
there
the
county
palatine
portia
he
doth
nothing
but
frown
as
who
should
say
an
you
will
not
have
me
choose
he
hears
merry
tales
and
smiles
not
i
fear
he
will
prove
the
weeping
philosopher
when
he
grows
old
being
so
full
of
unmannerly
sadness
in
his
youth
i
had
rather
be
married
to
a
deathshead
with
a
bone
in
his
mouth
than
to
either
of
these
god
defend
me
from
these
two
nerissa
how
say
you
by
the
french
lord
monsieur
le
bon
portia
god
made
him
and
therefore
let
him
pass
for
a
man
in
truth
i
know
it
is
a
sin
to
be
a
mocker
but
he
why
he
hath
a
horse
better
than
the
neapolitans
a
better
bad
habit
of
frowning
than
the
count
palatine
he
is
every
man
in
no
man
if
a
throstle
sing
he
falls
straight
acapring
he
will
fence
with
his
own
shadow
if
i
should
marry
him
i
should
marry
twenty
husbands
if
he
would
despise
me
i
would
forgive
him
for
if
he
love
me
to
madness
i
shall
never
requite
him
nerissa
what
say
you
then
to
falconbridge
the
young
baron
of
england
portia
you
know
i
say
nothing
to
him
for
he
understands
not
me
nor
i
him
he
hath
neither
latin
french
nor
italian
and
you
will
come
into
the
court
and
swear
that
i
have
a
poor
pennyworth
in
the
english
he
is
a
proper
mans
picture
but
alas
who
can
converse
with
a
dumbshow
how
oddly
he
is
suited
i
think
he
bought
his
doublet
in
italy
his
round
hose
in
france
his
bonnet
in
germany
and
his
behaviour
everywhere
nerissa
what
think
you
of
the
scottish
lord
his
neighbour
portia
that
he
hath
a
neighbourly
charity
in
him
for
he
borrowed
a
box
of
the
ear
of
the
englishman
and
swore
he
would
pay
him
again
when
he
was
able
i
think
the
frenchman
became
his
surety
and
seald
under
for
another
nerissa
how
like
you
the
young
german
the
duke
of
saxonys
nephew
portia
very
vilely
in
the
morning
when
he
is
sober
and
most
vilely
in
the
afternoon
when
he
is
drunk
when
he
is
best
he
is
a
little
worse
than
a
man
and
when
he
is
worst
he
is
little
better
than
a
beast
an
the
worst
fall
that
ever
fell
i
hope
i
shall
make
shift
to
go
without
him
nerissa
if
he
should
offer
to
choose
and
choose
the
right
casket
you
should
refuse
to
perform
your
fathers
will
if
you
should
refuse
to
accept
him
portia
therefore
for
fear
of
the
worst
i
pray
thee
set
a
deep
glass
of
rhenish
wine
on
the
contrary
casket
for
if
the
devil
be
within
and
that
temptation
without
i
know
he
will
choose
it
i
will
do
anything
nerissa
ere
i
will
be
married
to
a
sponge
nerissa
you
need
not
fear
lady
the
having
any
of
these
lords
they
have
acquainted
me
with
their
determinations
which
is
indeed
to
return
to
their
home
and
to
trouble
you
with
no
more
suit
unless
you
may
be
won
by
some
other
sort
than
your
fathers
imposition
depending
on
the
caskets
portia
if
i
live
to
be
as
old
as
sibylla
i
will
die
as
chaste
as
diana
unless
i
be
obtained
by
the
manner
of
my
fathers
will
i
am
glad
this
parcel
of
wooers
are
so
reasonable
for
there
is
not
one
among
them
but
i
dote
on
his
very
absence
and
i
pray
god
grant
them
a
fair
departure
nerissa
do
you
not
remember
lady
in
your
fathers
time
a
venetian
a
scholar
and
a
soldier
that
came
hither
in
company
of
the
marquis

foolish

thy
praise

if

could
bid

welcome
with
so
good
heart
as
i
can
bid
the
other
four
farewell
i
should
be
glad
of

shylock
ho
no
no
no
no
my
meaning
in
saying
he
is
a
good
man
is
to
have
you
understand
me
that
he
is
sufficient
yet
his
means
are
in
supposition
he
hath
an
argosy
bound
to

i
understand
moreover
upon
the
rialto
he
hath
a
third

a
fourth
for

he
hath
squandred

how
like
a
fawning
publican
he
looks
i
hate
him
for
he
is
a
christian
but
more
for
that
in
low
simplicity
he
lends
out
money
gratis
and
brings
down
the
rate
of
usance
here
with
us
in
venice
if
i
can
catch
him
once
upon
the
hip
i
will
feed
fat
the
ancient
grudge
i
bear
him
he
hates
our
sacred
nation
and
he
rails
even
there
where
merchants
most
do
congregate
on
me
my
bargains
and
my
wellwon
thrift
which
he
calls
interest
cursed
be
my
tribe
if
i
forgive
him
bassanio
shylock
do
you
hear
shylock
i
am
debating
of
my
present

by
the
near
guess
of
my
memory
i
cannot
instantly
raise
up
the
gross
of
full
three
thousand
ducats
what
of
that
tubal
a
wealthy
hebrew
of
my
tribe

the
eanlings
which
were
streakd
and
pied
should
fall
as
jacobs
hire
the
ewes
being
rank
in

when
the
work
of
generation
was
between
these
woolly
breeders
in
the
act
the
skilful
shepherd
pilld
me
certain
wands
and
in
the
doing
of
the
deed
of
kind
he
stuck
them
up
before
the
fulsome
ewes
who
then
conceiving
did
in
eaning
time
fall
particolourd
lambs
and
those
were
jacobs
this
was
a
way
to
thrive
and
he
was
blest
and
thrift
is
blessing
if
men
steal
it
not
antonio
this
was
a
venture
sir
that
jacob
servd
for
a
thing
not
in
his
power
to
bring
to
pass

swayd
and
fashiond

would
she
were
as
lying
a

in

ever
knappd
ginger

made
her
neighbours
believe
she
wept
for
the
death
of
a
third
husband
but
it
is
true
without
any
slips
of
prolixity
or
crossing
the
plain
highway
of
talk
that

good

more
difference
between

enter
bassanio
portia
gratiano
nerissa
and
all
their
trains

portia
i
pray
you
tarry
pause
a
day
or
two
before
you
hazard
for
in
choosing
wrong
i
lose
your
company
therefore
forbear
a
while
theres
something
tells
me
but
it
is
not
love
i
would
not
lose
you
and
you
know
yourself
hate
counsels
not
in
such
a
quality
but
lest
you
should
not
understand
me
well
and
yet
a
maiden
hath
no
tongue
but
thought
i
would
detain
you
here
some
month
or
two
before
you
venture
for
me
i
could
teach
you
how
to
choose
right
but
then
i
am
forsworn
so
will
i
never
be
so
may
you
miss
me
but
if
you
do
youll
make
me
wish
a
sin
that
i
had
been
forsworn
beshrew
your
eyes
they
have
oerlookd
me
and
divided
me
one
half
of
me
is
yours
the
other
half
yours
mine
own
i
would
say
but
if
mine
then
yours
and
so
all
yours
o
these
naughty
times
puts
bars
between
the
owners
and
their
rights
and
so
though
yours
not
yours
prove
it
so
let
fortune
go
to
hell
for
it
not
i
i
speak
too
long
but
tis
to
peize
the
time
to
eke
it
and
to
draw
it
out
in
length
to
stay
you
from
election
bassanio
let
me
choose
for
as
i
am
i
live
upon
the
rack
portia
upon
the
rack
bassanio
then
confess
what
treason
there
is
mingled
with
your
love
bassanio
none
but
that
ugly
treason
of
mistrust
which
makes
me
fear
th
enjoying
of
my
love
there
may
as
well
be
amity
and
life
tween
snow
and
fire
as
treason
and
my
love
portia
ay
but
i
fear
you
speak
upon
the
rack
where
men
enforced
do
speak
anything
bassanio
promise
me
life
and
ill
confess
the
truth
portia
well
then
confess
and
live
bassanio
confess
and
love
had
been
the
very
sum
of
my
confession
o
happy
torment
when
my
torturer
doth
teach
me
answers
for
deliverance
but
let
me
to
my
fortune
and
the
caskets
portia
away
then
i
am
lockd
in
one
of
them
if
you
do
love
me
you
will
find
me
out
nerissa
and
the
rest
stand
all
aloof
let
music
sound
while
he
doth
make
his
choice
then
if
he
lose
he
makes
a
swanlike
end
fading
in
music
that
the
comparison
may
stand
more
proper
my
eye
shall
be
the
stream
and
watry
deathbed
for
him
he
may
win
and
what
is
music
then
then
music
is
even
as
the
flourish
when
true
subjects
bow
to
a
newcrowned
monarch
such
it
is
as
are
those
dulcet
sounds
in
break
of
day
that
creep
into
the
dreaming
bridegrooms
ear
and
summon
him
to
marriage
now
he
goes
with
no
less
presence
but
with
much
more
love
than
young
alcides
when
he
did
redeem
the
virgin

bassanio
so
may
the
outward
shows
be
least
themselves
the
world
is
still
deceivd
with
ornament
in
law
what
plea
so
tainted
and
corrupt
but
being
seasond
with
a
gracious
voice
obscures
the
show
of
evil
in
religion
what
damned
error
but
some
sober
brow
will
bless
it
and
approve
it
with
a
text
hiding
the
grossness
with
fair
ornament
there
is
no
vice
so
simple
but
assumes
some
mark
of
virtue
on
his
outward
parts
how
many
cowards
whose
hearts
are
all
as
false
as
stairs
of
sand
wear
yet
upon
their
chins
the
beards
of
hercules
and
frowning
mars
who
inward
searchd
have
livers
white
as
milk
and
these
assume
but
valours
excrement
to
render
them
redoubted
look
on
beauty

you
shall

tis
purchasd
by
the
weight
which
therein
works
a
miracle
in
nature
making
them
lightest
that
wear
most
of
it
so
are
those
crisped
snaky
golden
locks
which
make
such
wanton
gambols
with
the
wind
upon
supposed
fairness
often
known
to
be
the
dowry
of
a
second
head
the
skull
that
bred
them
in
the
sepulchre
thus
ornament
is

the
guiled
shore

dangerous

how
could

to

having
made

methinks
it
should
have
power
to
steal
both
his
and
leave
itself
unfurnishd
yet
look
how
far
the
substance
of
my
praise
doth
wrong
this
shadow
in
underprizing
it
so
far
this
shadow
doth
limp
behind
the
substance
heres
the
scroll
the
continent
and
summary
of
my
fortune
you
that
choose
not
by
the
view
chance
as
fair
and
choose
as
true
since
this
fortune
falls
to
you
be
content
and
seek
no
new
if
you
be
well
pleasd
with
this
and
hold
your
fortune
for
your
bliss
turn
to
where
your
lady
is
and
claim
her
with
a
loving
kiss
a
gentle
scroll
fair
lady
by
your
leave
i
come
by
note
to
give
and
to
receive
like
one
of
two
contending
in
a
prize
that
thinks
he
hath
done
well
in
peoples
eyes
hearing
applause
and
universal
shout
giddy
in
spirit
still
gazing
in
a
doubt
whether
those
peals
of
praise
be
his
or
no
so
thricefair
lady
stand
i
even
so
as
doubtful
whether
what
i
see
be
true
until
confirmd
signd
ratified
by
you
portia
you
see
me
lord
bassanio
where
i
stand
such
as
i
am
though
for
myself
alone
i
would
not
be
ambitious
in
my
wish
to
wish
myself
much
better
yet
for
you
i
would
be
trebled
twenty
times
myself
a
thousand
times
more
fair
ten
thousand
times
more
rich
that
only
to
stand
high
in
your
account
i
might
in
virtues
beauties
livings
friends
exceed
account
but
the
full
sum
of
me
is
sum
of
something
which
to
term
in
gross
is
an
unlessond
girl
unschoold
unpractisd
happy
in
this
she
is
not
yet
so
old
but
she
may
learn
happier
than
this
she
is
not
bred
so
dull
but
she
can
learn
happiest
of
all
is
that
her
gentle
spirit
commits
itself
to
yours
to
be
directed
as
from
her
lord
her
governor
her
king
myself
and
what
is
mine
to
you
and
yours
is
now
converted
but
now
i
was
the
lord
of
this
fair
mansion
master
of
my
servants
queen
oer
myself
and
even
now
but
now
this
house
these
servants
and
this
same
myself
are
yours
my
lords
i
give
them
with
this
ring
which
when
you
part
from
lose
or
give
away
let
it
presage
the
ruin
of
your
love
and
be
my
vantage
to
exclaim
on
you
bassanio
madam
you
have
bereft
me
of
all
words
only
my
blood
speaks
to
you
in
my
veins
and
there
is
such
confusion
in
my
powers
as
after
some
oration
fairly
spoke
by
a
beloved
prince
there
doth
appear
among
the
buzzing
pleased
multitude
where
every
something
being
blent
together
turns
to
a
wild
of
nothing
save
of
joy
expressd
and
not
expressd
but
when
this
ring
parts
from
this
finger
then
parts
life
from
hence
o
then
be
bold
to
say
bassanios
dead
nerissa
my
lord
and
lady
it
is
now
our
time
that

stood
by

there
are
some
shrewd
contents
in
yond
same
paper
that
steals
the
colour
from
bassanios
cheek
some
dear
friend
dead
else
nothing
in
the
world
could
turn
so
much
the
constitution
of
any
constant
man
what
worse
and
worse
with
leave
bassanio
i
am
half
yourself
and
i
must
freely
have
the
half
of
anything
that
this
same
paper
brings
you
bassanio
o
sweet
portia
here
are
a
few
of
the
unpleasantst
words
that
ever
blotted
paper
gentle
lady
when
i
did
first
impart
my
love
to
you
i
freely
told
you
all
the
wealth
i
had
ran
in
my
veins
i
was
a
gentleman
and
then
i
told
you
true
and
yet
dear
lady
rating
myself
at
nothing
you
shall
see
how
much
i
was
a
braggart
when
i
told
you
my
state
was
nothing
i
should
then
have
told
you
that
i
was
worse
than
nothing
for
indeed
i
have
engagd
myself
to
a
dear
friend
engagd
my
friend
to
his
mere
enemy
to
feed
my
means
here
is
a
letter
lady
the
paper
as
the
body
of
my
friend
and
every
word
in
it
a
gaping
wound
issuing
lifeblood
but
is
it
true
salerio
hath
all
his
ventures
faild
what
not
one
hit
from
tripolis
from
mexico
and
england
from
lisbon
barbary
and
india
and
not
one

scape
the
dreadful
touch
of
merchantmarring
rocks
salerio
not
one
my
lord
besides
it
should
appear
that
if
he
had
the
present
money
to
discharge
the
jew
he
would
not
take
it
never
did
i
know
a
creature
that
did
bear
the
shape
of
man
so
keen
and
greedy
to
confound
a
man
he
plies
the
duke
at
morning
and
at
night
and
doth
impeach
the
freedom
of
the
state
if
they
deny
him
justice
twenty
merchants
the
duke
himself
and
the
magnificoes
of
greatest
port
have
all
persuaded
with
him
but
none
can
drive
him
from
the
envious
plea
of
forfeiture
of
justice
and
his
bond
jessica
when
i
was
with
him
i
have
heard
him
swear
to
tubal
and
to
chus
his
countrymen
that
he
would
rather
have
antonios
flesh
than
twenty
times
the
value
of
the
sum
that
he
did
owe
him
and
i

what

three

and
then
away
to

to
your

for
never
shall
you
lie
by

with
an
unquiet
soul
you
shall
have

to

the
petty
debt
twenty

when

but
since
i

beware
my

the

fond

with

at
his

antonio
i
pray
thee
hear

ill

i

therefore

antonio
let

he
seeks

his

well
i
know
i
oft
deliverd
from
his
forfeitures
many
that
have
at
times
made
moan
to
me
therefore
he
hates
me
solanio
i
am
sure
the
duke
will
never
grant
this
forfeiture
to
hold
antonio
the
duke
cannot
deny
the
course
of
law
for
the
commodity
that
strangers
have
with
us
in
venice
if
it
be
denied
will
much
impeach
the
justice
of
the
state
since
that
the
trade

profit
of

consisteth

therefore
go

lorenzo
madam
although
i
speak

in

you
have
a
noble
and
a
true
conceit
of
godlike
amity
which
appears
most
strongly
in
bearing
thus
the
absence
of
your
lord
but
if
you
knew
to
whom
you
show
this
honour
how

never

for

nor
shall

now
for
in
companions
that
do
converse
and
waste
the

together
whose
souls
do
bear
an
equal
yoke
of
love
there
must
be
needs
a
like
proportion
of
lineaments
of
manners
and
of
spirit
which
makes
me
think
that
this
antonio
being
the
bosom
lover
of
my

must
needs
be
like
my
lord
if
it

the
cost
i
have
bestowed
in
purchasing
the
semblance
of
my
soul
from

hellish
cruelty

comes

you

there

one
hope
in

that

do
you
any
good
and
that
is
but
a
kind
of
bastard
hope
neither

what
hope
is
that

partly
hope
that
your

got
you
not
that
you
are
not
the

jessica
that

a
kind
of
bastard
hope
indeed
so
the
sins
of
my

i

you
are
damnd
both
by

he
we

christians
enow
before
een
as
many
as

well
live
one

this
making

me
in

because
i
am
a
jews
daughter
and
he
says
you
are
no
good
member

for
in
converting

you

is
antonio

please
your
grace
duke
of
venice
i
am
sorry
for
thee
thou
art
come
to
answer
a
stony
adversary
an
inhuman
wretch
uncapable
of
pity
void
and
empty
from
any
dram
of
mercy
antonio
i
have
heard
your
grace
hath
taen
great
pains
to
qualify
his
rigorous
course
but
since
he
stands
obdurate
and
that
no
lawful
means
can
carry
me
out
of
his
envys
reach
i
do
oppose
my
patience
to
his
fury
and
am
armd
to
suffer
with
a
quietness
of
spirit
the
very
tyranny
and
rage
of
his
duke

and
call
the
jew

make
room
and
let
him
stand
before
our
face
shylock
the
world
thinks
and
i
think
so
too
that
thou
but
leadest
this
fashion
of
thy
malice
to
the
last
hour
of
act
and
then
tis
thought
thoult
show
thy
mercy
and
remorse
more
strange
than
is
thy
strange
apparent
cruelty
and
where
thou
now
exacts
the
penalty
which
is
a
pound
of
this
poor
merchants
flesh
thou
wilt
not
only
loose
the
forfeiture
but
touchd
with
human
gentleness
and
love
forgive
a
moiety
of
the
principal
glancing
an
eye
of
pity
on
his
losses
that
have
of
late
so
huddled
on
his
back
enow
to
press
a
royal
merchant
down
and
pluck
commiseration
of
his
state
from
brassy
bosoms
and
rough
hearts
of
flint
from
stubborn
turks
and
tartars
never
traind
to
offices
of
tender
courtesy
we
all
expect
a
gentle
answer
jew
shylock
i
have
possessd
your
grace
of
what
i
purpose
and
by
our
holy
sabbath
have
i
sworn
to
have
the
due
and
forfeit
of
my
bond
if
you
deny
it
let
the
danger
light
upon
your
charter
and
your
citys
freedom
youll
ask
me
why
i
rather
choose
to
have
a
weight
of
carrion
flesh
than
to
receive
three
thousand
ducats
ill
not
answer
that
but
say
it
is
my
humour
is
it
answerd
what
if
my
house
be
troubled
with
a
rat
and
i
be
pleasd
to
give
ten
thousand
ducats
to
have
it
band
what
are
you
answerd
yet
some
men
there
are
love
not
a
gaping
pig
some
that
are
mad
if
they
behold
a
cat
and
others
when
the
bagpipe
sings
i
th
nose
cannot
contain
their
urine
for
affection
mistress
of
passion
sways
it
to
the
mood
of
what
it
likes
or
loathes
now
for
your
answer
as
there
is
no
firm
reason
to
be
rendred
why
he
cannot
abide
a
gaping
pig
why
he
a
harmless
necessary
cat
why
he
a
woollen
bagpipe
but
of
force
must
yield
to
such
inevitable
shame
as
to
offend
himself
being
offended
so
can
i
give
no
reason
nor
i
will
not
more
than
a
lodgd
hate
and
a
certain
loathing
i
bear
antonio
that
i
follow
thus
a
losing
suit
against
him
are
you
answered
bassanio
this
is
no
answer
thou
unfeeling
man
to
excuse
the
current
of
thy
cruelty
shylock
i
am
not
bound
to
please
thee
with
my
answers
bassanio
do
all
men
kill
the
things
they
do
not
love
shylock
hates
any
man
the
thing
he
would
not
kill
bassanio
every
offence
is
not
a
hate
at
first
shylock
what
wouldst
thou
have
a
serpent
sting
thee
twice
antonio
i
pray
you
think
you
question
with
the
jew
you
may
as
well
go
stand
upon
the
beach
and
bid
the
main
flood
bate
his
usual
height
you
may
as
well
use
question
with
the
wolf
why
he
hath
made
the
ewe
bleat
for
the
lamb
you
may
as
well
forbid
the
mountain
pines
to
wag
their
high
tops
and
to
make
no
noise
when
they
are
fretten
with
the
gusts
of
heaven
you
may
as
well
do
anything
most
hard
as
seek
to
soften
that
than
which
whats
harder
his
jewish
heart
therefore
i
do
beseech
you
make
no
moe
offers
use
no
farther
means
but
with
all
brief
and
plain
conveniency
let
me
have
judgment
and
the
jew
his
will
bassanio
for
thy
three
thousand
ducats
here
is
six
shylock
if
every
ducat
in
six
thousand
ducats
were
in
six
parts
and
every
part
a
ducat
i
would
not
draw
them
i
would
have
my
bond
duke
of
venice
how
shalt
thou
hope
for
mercy
rendring
none
shylock
what
judgment
shall
i
dread
doing
no
wrong
you
have
among
you
many
a
purchasd
slave
which
fike
your
asses
and
your
dogs
and
mules
you
use
in
abject
and
in
slavish
parts
because
you
bought
them
shall
i
say
to
you
let
them
be
free
marry
them
to
your
heirs
why
sweat
they
under
burdens
let
their
beds
be
made
as
soft
as
yours
and
let
their
palates
be
seasond
with
such
viands
you
will
answer
the
slaves

ours
so
do
i
answer
you
the
pound
of
flesh
which
i
demand
of
him
is
dearly
bought
tis
mine
and
i
will
have
it
if
you
deny
me
fie
upon
your
law
there
is
no
force
in
the
decrees
of
venice
i
stand
for
judgment
answer
shall
i
have
it
duke
of
venice
upon
my
power
i
may

very
sick
but
in
the
instant
that
your
messenger
came
in
loving
visitation
was
with
me
a
young
doctor
of
rome
his
name
is
balthazar
i
acquainted
him
with
the
cause
in
controversy
between
the
jew
and
antonio
the
merchant
we
turnd
oer
many
books
together
he
is
furnished
with
my
opinion
which
bettered
with
his
own
learningthe
greatness
whereof
i
cannot
enough
commend
comes
with
him
at
my
importunity
to
fill
up
your
graces
request
in
my
stead
i
beseech
you
let
his
lack
of
years
be
no
impediment
to
let
him
lack
a
reverend
estimation
for
i
never
knew
so
young
a
body
with
so
old
a
head
i
leave
him
to
your
gracious
acceptance
whose
trial
shall
better
publish
his
commendation

enter
portia
for
balthazar
dressed
like
a
doctor
of
laws

duke
of
venice
you
hear
the
learnd
bellario
what
he
writes
and
here
i
take
it
is
the
doctor
come
give
me
your
hand
come
you
from
old
bellario
portia
i
did
my
lord
duke
of
venice
you
are
welcome
take
your
place
are
you
acquainted
with
the
difference
that
holds
this
present
question
in
the
court
portia
i
am
informed
throughly
of
the
cause
which
is
the
merchant
here
and
which
the
jew
duke
of
venice
antonio
and
old
shylock
both
stand
forth
portia
is
your
name
shylock
shylock
shylock
is
my
name
portia
of
a
strange
nature
is
the
suit
you
follow
yet
in
such
rule
that
the
venetian
law
cannot
impugn
you
as
you
do
proceed
you
stand
within
his
danger
do
you
not
antonio
ay
so
he
says
portia
do
you
confess
the
bond
antonio
i
do
portia
then
must
the
jew
be
merciful
shylock
on
what
compulsion
must
i
tell
me
that
portia
the
quality
of
mercy
is
not
straind
it
droppeth
as
the
gentle
rain
from
heaven
upon
the
place
beneath
it
is
twice
blest
it
blesseth
him
that
gives
and
him
that
takes
tis
mightiest
in
the
mightiest
it
becomes
the
throned
monarch
better
than
his
crown
his
sceptre
shows
the
force
of
temporal
power
the
attribute
to
awe
and
majesty
wherein
doth
sit
the
dread
and
fear
of
kings
but
mercy
is
above
this
sceptred
sway
it
is
enthroned
in
the
hearts
of
kings
it
is
an
attribute
to
god
himself
and
earthly
power
doth
then
show
likest
gods
when
mercy
seasons
justice
therefore
jew
though
justice
be
thy
plea
consider
this
that
in
the
course
of
justice
none
of
us
should
see
salvation
we
do
pray
for
mercy
and
that
same
prayer
doth
teach
us
all
to
render
the
deeds
of
mercy
i
have
spoke
thus
much
to
mitigate
the
justice
of
thy
plea
which
if
thou
follow
this
strict
court
of
venice
must
needs
give
sentence
gainst
the
merchant
there
shylock
my
deeds
upon
my
head
i
crave
the
law
the
penalty
and
forfeit
of
my
bond
bassanio
yes
here
i
tender
it
for
him
in
the
court
yea
twice
the
sum
if
that
will
not
suffice
i
will
be
bound
to
pay
it
ten
times
oer
on
forfeit
of
my
hands
my
head
my
heart
if
this
will
not
suffice
it
must
appear
that
malice
bears
down
truth
and
i
beseech
you
wrest
once
the
law
to
your
authority
to
do
a
great
right
do
a
little
wrong
and
curb
this
cruel
devil
of
his
will
portia
it
must
not
be
there
is
no
power
in
venice
can
alter
a
decree
established
twill
be
recorded
for
a
precedent
and
many
an
error
by
the
same
example

exit
stephano
how
sweet
the
moonlight
sleeps
upon
this
bank
here
will
we
sit
and
let
the
sounds
of
music
creep
in
our
ears
soft
stillness
and
the
night
become
the
touches
of
sweet
harmony
sit
jessica
look
how
the
floor
of
heaven
is
thick
inlaid
with
patines
of
bright
gold
theres
not
the
smallest
orb
which
thou
beholdst
but
in
his
motion
like
an
angel
sings
still
quiring
to
the
youngeyd
cherubins
such
harmony
is
in
immortal
souls
but
whilst
this
muddy
vesture
of
decay
doth
grossly
close
it
in
we
cannot
hear
it

enter
musicians

come
ho
and
wake
diana
with
a
hymn
with
sweetest
touches
pierce
your
mistress
ear
and
draw
her
home
with
music























music
jessica
i
am
never
merry
when
i
hear
sweet
music
lorenzo
the
reason
is
your
spirits
are
attentive
for
do
but
note
a
wild
and
wanton
herd
or
race
of
youthful
and
unhandled
colts
fetching
mad
bounds
bellowing
and
neighing
loud
which
is
the
hot
condition
of
their
blood
if
they
but
hear
perchance
a
trumpet
sound
or
any
air
of
music
touch
their
ears
you
shall
perceive
them
make
a
mutual
stand
their
savage
eyes
turnd
to
a
modest
gaze
by
the
sweet
power
of
music
therefore
the
poet
did
feign
that
orpheus
drew
trees
stones
and
floods
since
nought
so
stockish
hard
and
full
of
rage
but
music
for
the
time
doth
change
his
nature
the
man
that
hath
no
music
in
himself
nor
is
not
movd
with
concord
of
sweet
sounds
is
fit
for
treasons
stratagems
and
spoils
the
motions
of
his
spirit
are
dullas
night
and
his
affections
dark
as
erebus
let
no
such
man
be
trusted
mark
the
music

enter
portia
and
nerissa

portia
that
light
we
see
is
burning
in
my
hall
how
far
that
little
candle
throws
his
beams
so
shines
a
good
deed
in
a
naughty
world
nerissa
when
the
moon
shone
we
did
not
see
the
candle
portia
so
doth
the
greater
glory
dim
the
less
a
substitute
shines
brightly
as
a
king
until
a
king
be
by
and
then
his
state
empties
itself
as
doth
an
inland
brook
into
the
main
of
waters
music
hark
nerissa
it
is
your
music
madam
of
the
house
portia
nothing
is
good
i
see
without
respect
methinks
it
sounds
much
sweeter

like
cutlers
poetry
upon

wear
it
till
your
hour
of
death
and
that
it
should
lie
with
you
in
your
grave

not
for
me
yet
for
your
vehement
oaths

should
have
been
respective
and

kept

a
judges
clerk
no
gods
my
judge
the
clerk
will
neer
wear

an
if

to
be
a
man
nerissa
ay
if
a
woman
live
to
be
a
man
gratiano
now
by
this
hand
i
gave
it
to
a
youth
a
kind
of
boy
a
little
scrubbed
boy
no
higher
than
thyself
the
judges
clerk
a
prating
boy
that
beggd
it
as
a
fee
i
could
not
for
my
heart
deny
it
him
portia
you
were
to
blame
i
must
be
plain
with
you
to
part
so
slightly
with
your
wifes
first
gift
a
thing
stuck
on
with
oaths
upon
your
finger
and
so
riveted
with
faith
unto
your
flesh
i
gave
my
love
a
ring
and
made
him
swear
never
to
part
with
it
and
here
he
stands
i
dare
be
sworn
for
him
he
would
not
leave
it
nor
pluck
it
from
his
finger
for
the
wealth
that
the
world
masters
now
in
faith
gratiano
you
give
your
wife
too
unkind
a
cause
of
grief
an
twere
to
me
i
should
be
mad
at
it
bassanio

aside

why
i
were
best
to
cut
my
left
hand
off
and
swear
i
lost
the
ring
defending
it
gratiano
my
lord
bassanio
gave
his
ring
away
unto
the
judge
that
beggd
it
and
indeed
deservd
it
too
and
then
the
boy
his
clerk
that
took
some
pains
in
writing
he
beggd
mine
and
neither
man
nor
master
would
take
aught
but
the
two
rings
portia
what
ring
gave
you
my
lord
not
that
i
hope
which
you
receivd
of
me
bassanio
if
i
could
add
a
lie
unto
a
fault
i
would
deny
it
but
you
see
my
finger
hath
not
the
ring
upon
it
it
is
gone
portia
even
so
void
is
your
false
heart
of
truth
by
heaven
i
will
neer
come
in
your
bed
until
i
see
the
ring
nerissa
nor
i
in
yours
till
i
again
see
mine
bassanio
sweet
portia
if
you
did
know
to
whom
i
gave
the
ring
if
you
did
know
for
whom
i
gave
the
ring
and
would
conceive
for
what
i
gave
the
ring
and
how
unwillingly
i
left
the
ring
when
nought
would
be
accepted
but
the
ring
you
would
abate
the
strength
of
your
displeasure
portia
if
you
had
known
the
virtue
of
the
ring
or
half
her
worthiness
that
gave
the
ring
or
your
own
honour
to
contain
the
ring
you
would
not
then
have
parted
with
the
ring
what
man
is
there
so
much
unreasonable
if
you
had
pleasd
to
have
defended
it
with
any
terms
of
zeal
wanted
the
modesty
to
urge
the
thing
held
as
a
ceremony
nerissa
teaches
me
what
to
believe
ill
die
fort
but
some
woman
had
the
ring
bassanio
no
by
my
honour
madam
by
my
soul
no
woman
had
it
but
a
civil
doctor
which
did
refuse
three
thousand
ducats
of
me
and
beggd
the
ring
the
which
i
did
deny
him
and
sufferd
him
to
go
displeasd
away
even
he
that
had
held
up
the
very
life
of
my
dear
friend
what
should
i
say

was
enforcd
to

mrs

we
burn
daylight
here
read
read
perceive
how
i
might
be
knighted
i
shall
think
the
worse
of
fat
men
as
long
as
i
have
an
eye
to
make
difference
of
mens
liking
and
yet
he
would
not
swear
praisd
womens
modesty
and
gave
such
orderly
and
wellbehaved
reproof
to
all
uncomeliness
that
i
would
have
sworn
his
disposition
would
have
gone
to
the
truth
of
his
words
but
they
do
no
more
adhere
and
keep
place
together
than
the
hundredth
psalm
to
the
tune
of
greensleeves
what
tempest
i
trow
threw
this
whale
with
so
many
tuns
of
oil
in
his
belly
ashore
at
windsor
how
shall
i
be
revenged
on
him
i
think
the
best
way
were
to
entertain
him
with
hope
till
the
wicked
fire
of
lust
have
melted
him
in
his
own
grease
did
you
ever
hear
the
like
mrs
page
letter
for
letter
but
that
the
name
of
page
and
ford
differs
to
thy
great
comfort
in
this
mystery
of
ill
opinions
heres
the
twinbrother
of
thy
letter
but
let
thine
inherit
first
for

protest
mine

a
thousand
of
these
letters
writ
with
blank
space
for
different
namessure
moreand
these
are
of
the
second
edition
he
will
print
them
out
of
doubt
for
he
cares
not
what
he
puts
into
the
press
when
he
would
put
us
two
i
had
rather
be
a
giantess
and
lie
under
mount
pelion
well
i
will
find
you
twenty
lascivious
turtles
ere
one
chaste
man
mrs

why
this
is
the
very
same
the
very
hand
the
very
words
what
doth
he
think
of
us
mrs

nay
i
know
not
it
makes
me
almost
ready
to
wrangle
with
mine
own
honesty
ill
entertain
myself
like
one
that
i
am
not
acquainted
withal
for
sure
unless
he

some
strain
in

fury

sully
the
chariness
of

o
that
my

give

food
to
his
jealousy

experience
be
a
jewel

hath
taught

now
sir

here

the
heart
of
my
purpose
you
are
a

of
excellent
breeding
admirable
discourse
of
great
admittance
authentic
in
your

generally
allowd
for
your
many
warlike
courtlike

learned
preparations
falstaff

of

use
your

of
wooing
win
her
to
consent
to
you
if
any
man
may
you
may
as
soon
as
any
falstaff
would
it
apply
well
to
the
vehemency
of
your
affection
that

should
win
what
you
would
enjoy
methinks
you
prescribe
to
yourself
very
preposterously
ford

understand
my
drift

so
securely
on

excellency
of
her
honour
that
the
folly
of
my
soul
dares
not
present
itself
she
is
too
bright
to
be
lookd
against
now
could
i
come
to
her
with
any
detection
in
my
hand
my
desires
had
instance
and
argument
to
commend
themselves
i
could
drive
her
then
from
the
ward
of
her
purity
her
reputation
her
marriage
vow

a
thousand
other
her
defences

the
peaking
cornuto
her
husband
master
brook
dwelling
in
a
continual
larum
of
jealousy
comes
me
in
the
instant
of
our
encounter
after
we
had
embracd
kissd
protested
and
as
it
were
spoke
the
prologue
of
our
comedy
and
at
his
heels
a
rabble
of
his
companions
thither
provoked
and
instigated
by
his
distemper
and
forsooth
to
search
his
house
for
his
wifes
love
ford

while
you
were
there

good
luck

in
one
mistress

intelligence
of
fords
approach
and
in
her
invention
and
fords
wifes
distraction
they
conveyd
me
into
a
buckbasket
ford
a
buckbasket
falstaff
by
the
lord
a
buckbasket
rammd
me
in
with
foul
shirts
and
smocks
socks
foul
stockings
greasy
napkins
that
master
brook
there
was
the
rankest
compound
of
villainous
smell
that
ever
offended
nostril
ford
and
how
long
lay
you
there
falstaff
nay
you
shall
hear
master
brook
what
i
have
sufferd
to
bring
this
woman
to
evil
for
your
good
being
thus
crammd
in
the
basket
a
couple
of
fords
knaves
his
hinds
were
calld
forth
by
their
mistress
to
carry
me
in
the
name
of
foul
clothes
to
datchet
lane
they
took
me
on
their
shoulders
met
the
jealous
knave
their
master
in
the
door
who
askd
them
once
or
twice
what
they
had
in
their
basket
i
quakd
for
fear
lest
the
lunatic
knave
would
have
searchd
it
but
fate
ordaining
he
should
be
a
cuckold
held
his
hand
well
on
went
he
for
a
search
and
away
went
i
for
foul
clothes
but
mark
the
sequel
master
brooki
suffered
the
pangs
of
three
several
deaths
first
an
intolerable
fright
to
be
detected
with
a
jealous
rotten
bellwether
next
to
be
compassd
like
a
good
bilbo
in
the
circumference
of
a
peck
hilt
to
point
heel
to
head
and
then
to
be
stoppd
in
like
a
strong
distillation
with
stinking
clothes
that
fretted
in
their
own
grease
think
of
that
a
man
of
my
kidney
think
of
thatthat
am
as
subject
to
heat
as
butter
a
man
of
continual
dissolution
and
thaw
it
was
a
miracle
to
scape
suffocation
and
in
the
height
of
this
bath
when
i
was
more
than
halfstewd
in
grease
like
a
dutch
dish
to
be
thrown
into
the
thames
and
coold
glowing
hot
in
that
surge
like
a
horseshoe
think
of
that
hissing
hot
think
of
that
master
brook
ford
in
good
sadness

mistress

hugh
evans

evans
tis
one
of
the
best
discretions
of
a
oman
as
ever
did
look
upon

and
did
he
send
you
both
these
letters
at
an

mrs

within

quarter

ford
pardon
me
wife
henceforth
do
what
thou
wilt
i
rather
will
suspect
the
sun
with
cold
than
thee
with
wantonness
now
doth
thy
honour
stand
in
him
that
was
of
late
an
heretic
as
firm
as
faith
page
tis
well
tis
well
no
more
be
not
as
extreme
in
submission
as
in
offence
but
let
our
plot
go
forward
let
our
wives
yet
once
again
to
make
us
public
sport
appoint
a
meeting
with
this
old
fat
fellow
where
we
may
take
him
and
disgrace
him
for
it
ford
there
is
no
better
way
than
that
they
spoke
of
page
how
to
send
him
word
theyll
meet
him
in
the
park
at
midnight
fie
fie
hell
never
come
evans
you
say
he
has
been
thrown
in
the
rivers
and
has
been
grievously
peaten
as
an
old
oman
methinks
there
should
be
terrors
in
him
that
he
should
not
come
methinks
his
flesh
is
punishd
he
shall
have
no
desires
page
so
think
i
too
mrs
ford
devise
but
how
youll
use
him
when
he
comes
and
let
us
two
devise
to
bring
him
thither
mrs
page
there
is
an
old
tale
goes
that
heme
the
hunter
sometime
a
keeper
here
in
windsor
forest
doth
all
the
wintertime
at
still
midnight
walk
round
about
an
oak
with
great
raggd
horns
and
there
he
blasts
the
tree
and
takes
the
cattle
and
makes
milchkine
yield
blood
and
shakes
a
chain
in
a
most
hideous
and
dreadful
manner
you
have
heard
of
such
a
spirit
and
well
you
know
the
superstitious
idleheaded
eld
receivd
and
did
deliver
to
our
age
this
tale
of
heme
the
hunter
for
a
truth
page
why
yet
there
want
not
many
that
do
fear
in
deep
of
night
to
walk
by
this
hernes
oak
but
what
of
this
mrs
ford
marry
this
is
our
device
that
falstaff
at
that
oak
shall
meet
with
us
disguisd
like
heme
with
huge
horns
on
his
head
page
well
let
it
not
be
doubted
but
hell
come
and
in
this
shape
when
you
have
brought
him
thither
what
shall
be
done
with
him
what
is
your
plot
mrs
page
that
likewise
have
we
thought
upon
and
thus
nan
page
my
daughter
and
my
little
son
and
three
or
four
more
of
their
growth
well
dress
like
urchins
ouphes
and
fairies
green
and
white
with
rounds
of
waxen
tapers
on
their
heads
and
rattles
in
their
hands
upon
a
sudden
as
falstaff
she
and
i
are
newly
met
let
them
from
forth
a
sawpit
rush
at
once
with
some
diffused
song
upon
their
sight
we
two
in
great
amazedness
will
fly
then
let
them
all
encircle
him
about
and
fairylike
to
pinch
the
unclean
knight
and
ask
him
why
that
hour
of
fairy
revel
in
their
so
sacred
paths
he
dares
to
tread
in
shape
profane
mrs
ford
and
till
he
tell
the
truth
let
the
supposed
fairies
pinch
him
sound
